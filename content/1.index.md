  #body
  I lead developer experience at [Contentstack](https://contentstack.com). I work on platform strategy, extensibility, and how teams build products that developers actually want to use. AI has changed how we ship—speed is table stakes. The real differentiator is taste and systems thinking. [MACH Alliance](https://machalliance.com) Tech Council, [NuxtJS](https://nuxt.com), [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com), [Supabase](https://supabase.com), and [Algolia](https://algolia.com) ambassador.

  #body
  Output is cheap; the bottleneck is judgment. I focus on AI-augmented engineering with discipline, the rise of the engineer-PM hybrid, developer experience as strategy, and taste over output. In an era of infinite generation, what distinguishes strong technical judgment from noise matters more than ever.

:::content-richtext
#body
I’m an engineer and product thinker focused on developer platforms and AI-accelerated software development. I’ve spent my career helping teams move from shipping features to building systems that scale, from tool-centric thinking to experience-driven design, and from speed as a goal to judgment as an advantage. I believe the future belongs to engineers who can think in systems, design for extensibility, and use AI as leverage without outsourcing responsibility.
