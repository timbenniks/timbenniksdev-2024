Get ready to rock out at your next tech conference! I've created an electrifying browser-based karaoke experience tailored explicitly for rock & roll guitar. Using the innovative power of Vue, Nuxt, webmidi, [Supabase](https://supabase.com), [Cloudinary](https://clouidnary.com), [Hygraph](https://hygraph.com), and [Vercel](https://vercel.com), everything from the backing tracks to the guitar amp presets is dynamically controlled.

Alive and Kicking is an immersive presentation that showcases what composable architectures can do. It offers attendees an interactive guitar karaoke experience, allowing them to participate in a live-voting system and engage with the content through audience participation.

  You, the audience, get to participate too! By logging in with your Twitter or Github account, you can live-vote what songs I should play next during my guitar karaoke performance.
  
  But that's not all - every vote you cast will be displayed on the big screen as a bouncing ball, making you a part of the talk. You vote, I play - let's make this a night to remember!
  
  After voting for your favorite song, you can share a personalized image of the song and your profile picture on your social media accounts.
