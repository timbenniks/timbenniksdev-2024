title: "Composable without Compromise: Team Diversity for success with Jasmin Guthmann"
description: "In this live stream our host Tim Benniks interviews special guest Jasmin Guthmann with the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. What is an unexpected or surprising outcome of transitioning from a monolithic to a composable architecture?\r\n2. If you had to advise agency or SaaS company execs, what would it be?\r\n3. If you could wave a magic wand and change something in our space, what would it be?\r\n4. What bottlenecks have you seen in composable architectures? This could be any bottleneck, from tech to process.\r\n5. What feature from old technology would you like to bring back?\r\n6. How would you explain composable architectures to a 15 year old?\r\n\r\n\r\nLivestream Host: Tim Benniks \r\nhttps://twitter.com/timbenniks\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/timbenniks/\r\n\r\nJoin us on Discord at https://uniform.to/discord\r\nLearn more at https://uniform.dev\r\n\r\nFollow us on:\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/people/Uniform/\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/UniformDev \r\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/uniformdev \r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/uniform.dev/"
