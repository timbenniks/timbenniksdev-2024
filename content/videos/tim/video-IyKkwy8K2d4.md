title: "How to reduce bundle sizes in Nuxt"
description: "Everybody wants smaller JavaScript bundles. In this video Lucie Haberer and I explore a way to reduce bundle sizes in Nuxt.\n\n1. We explore data abstraction and moving data mapping to a data layer that is only accessed by the asyncData or Fetch. \n2. We discuss moving bigger functionality to serverless API's\n3. We show how to make smaller \"named\" webpack chunks\n\nThis video is in-depth (25 mins), have a seat, take your time and enjoy. Happy optimizing!\nBeware, this works best for statically rendered Nuxt projects.\n\nhttps://lihbr.com/blog/pushing-nuxt-js-static-generation-one-step-further\n\nFollow Lucie here: \nWebsite: https://lihbr.com/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/li_hbr\nGithub: https://github.com/lihbr\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.dev/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks\n\n#javascript #bundlesizes #nuxt"
