title: "Tim Tries Medusajs the open source Shopify alternative"
description: "Sometimes I try out tech or web services for the first time. I give feedback as I go, in real-time. This is the #TimTries Series. In this episode, I try out #Medusajs, an open-source #ecommerce alternative to Shopify.\n\nConclusion: excellent, great, awesome, composable, performant. But why is this not a Saas? I'd happily pay a few bucks a month for this!\n\nFollow medusa: \nhttps://medusajs.com\nhttps://github.com/medusajs/medusa\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.dev\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGitHub: https://github.com/timbenniks"
