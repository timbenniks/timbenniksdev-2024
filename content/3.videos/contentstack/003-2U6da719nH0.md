transcript: This is Tim from Content Stack and in this video I'll give you a quick platform overview and I'll show you a few golden nuggets that not everybody always finds. So when you log in you end up here. This is your dashboard and as you can see there's a bunch of different products here and so what this means is that content is a content platform and on a platform you have different products that can either work on their own or they can be combined. Right? So you can actually use the headless CMS and then deploy it on launch and then use a bunch of analytics to look at what people do with your content, things like that. And so you can use all of those together to make your, you know, projects awesome. On the site, you get um links to our academy, documentation, things like joining our Discord community, the latest events that we are, you know, um attending or organizing. You can dive right into academy courses. We have product change logs. All that kind of stuff is right at your fingertips. And so for those golden nuggets, things like this, there's an app switcher here, but you see there are some favorites. So when I go to my CMS, and I might potentially in the future have a bunch of different projects, I can actually just favorite this and then directly go there. Those things are just really handy. Um, next to that, we have the help center. And so this help center is not just the docs. It's actually contextual to where you are. I'm now sitting here in my headless CMS stacks and it tells me exactly about those tags. But what if I go to let's say my entries overview? Well, then it actually explains how do I create an entry? So all the questions you might have specifically what you're dealing with, for example, how do content models work? Can I import one? All of that is exactly right there. And so we implore you to use your full account with Explorer. Try all the things and you can choose everything from here and try to connect them up or use them individually and really have fun with it. So join our community on Discord. Just click this little link here. Tell us about what you're building, your questions, your feedback, anything that you want to discuss, that's the place for you. All right, so that's it. Happy exploring and happy coding. Cheers.
