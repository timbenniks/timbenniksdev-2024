transcript: Data and insights are now available to all current content stack customers. In your base package, you get the following things. The opportunity explorer, the content graph, the audience explorer, and the advanced audience builder. And in this video, I'll show you how to get started quickly. Let's dive into how you can sync an audience from our data and insights app into content stack personalized to show a different variant of a page. So imagine you have earring enthusiasts. So why not show them a homepage that's more focused on earrings so they can find what they need much faster, can dive in immediately because this homepage seems to know them. Well, let's have a look at our data and insights app here in litics and actually look at that audience. So I already created one and now we just need to sync it to content stack. So, while we wait for this to load, you will need the content stack personalized products to be able to sync these in and then show different variants of your page. So, let's go to profile and audiences. And so, I have a few of those, right? So, I have most recently viewed earrings, uh, earring enthusiasts, or I have like likes, gold material, things like that. And so, when you hit edit here, you can actually see that this affinity for earrings is there or they just visited a page that is an earring. And so this is now synced through the data um activation layer into contact personalize. So let's have a look at personalize first to see how that is all connected up. So here I have my VA project. You can see I have a love earrings experience already. So we actually have audiences. You see this is the earring enthusiast that actually comes from the data and insights app analytics. This is now connected into content stack. So again, you need to buy this product to make this work. But now we can connect it to an experience. And so when that audience hit here, the airing enthusiasts, I now have an experience that I can connect to a variant of any entry. And so when we now go to the CMS, you can see how that is set up here. So in the CMS, when we actually go to our settings, we have variants. And I actually have a love earring variant that is actually connected through personalize. So when we actually go there, well, let's let's have a look at our homepage. And let's of course visually build this homepage. Like what you see here is there's actually a love earring v variant. There's even a Valentine's variant that I created. So I can hit love earrings variant here. It reloads and now I'm actually editing the variant specifically for that earrings audience. And you can attach multiple audiences to one experience. So you can really build exactly what you need. And so this is now showing a list of of earrings. Of course, it's featuring earrings as well. And so to see this in practice, this is now the normal homepage. Litics doesn't really know me as much. There's a bunch of things I've clicked on, not as much. Well, let's now actually go to the earrings pages here and say, well, let's let's click a few. Right? I'm going through a bunch of different earrings here as if I am actually browsing and I'm really interested in earrings. What you'll see is that this is actually now an earrings focused homepage, right? Earrings for you, a list of earrings, you know, different type of information. This is actually very interesting way to kind of just slowly see what is your affinity. Let's actually show you that specific stuff. And so you can also see that I have an earrings audience here. I also like gold material apparently and my most recently visited category was also earrings and so now there's a pretty strong indication that my intent on this website is to look for earrings. Anyways, this is what I wanted to show you today and we just released this. We love for you to ask us questions to get you started with this fast. All right. Happy coding.
