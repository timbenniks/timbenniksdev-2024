title: Command Line Magic with Arke!
description: |-
  Join us for an in-depth technical demonstration of Beacon! Arke’s internal developer tool built to streamline composable workflows.
  We’ll explore why Beacon was created, walk through live use cases like schema management and disaster recovery and share how it's being used as a production-ready tool. You’ll also get a first look at the roadmap and learn how to get involved via GitHub.
