description: |-
  Contentstack offers a bootstrap cli command to get started with all Kickstarts in under one minut. Get the code running locally, and with environment variables in place.

  It's never been easier/faster to get started!

transcript: "[Music] At Contentac, we really value getting started quickly with all our base features. And so if you are a developer and you might not be inclined to read all the docs and learn everything before you go like me, we actually like to give you something like this. We can actually bootstrap from the CLI a starter kit that has everything in place and then you can look at the code and learn after. And so you don't have to struggle. It's just there. You can just learn. And so let's enable our live preview and let's, you know, npm run and install everything. Going to put it in my own employee or and call it test. And so now what's happening is we are bootstrapping for you a Kickstarter on your local host. We're importing a whole bunch of information and stack data into content in your account. And the only thing it doesn't do yet is actually turning on live preview in the settings. it actually tells you here. However, that's a really easy thing to do. And so, we're now installing with npm and we are essentially ready to go. So, now we are probably like a minute in and I now have a new stack in content stack and I have a Kickstarter running on Nex.js and I can hit start editing. And so, it will tell me now, okay, turn on your live preview. Well, let's do that. Just going to hit enable here and we're going to go back to our visual experience. And we now have official builder with our next kickstart. And the interesting thing here is that these kickstarts are really simple. So you get something that works. You have like 50 60 lines of code and you can essentially just get going here. Let me show you. Um essentially this is all you have to worry about and it's fully annotated. Everything is explained. We're importing things. We're making a stack. We're setting up live preview. We're querying the database. And we are ready to run. And so we really wanted to make it simple for you to get started, have all the features in place, look at very clean code in the context of your meta framework, and then you can learn after what happened, and you're good to go and run. So happy coding, and I'll see you soon in our community. Cheers."
