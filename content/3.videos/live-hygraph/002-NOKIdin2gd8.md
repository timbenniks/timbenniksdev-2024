transcript: "[Music] all right we are live actually I started the timer and then I hit go live and it took 20 seconds to go live so I think the audience saw like five four three and then bam here we are and for us it took a while anyways we are here and I'm here with the guys from drix with Reinhardt and Marcus and so we're going to be talking about their new composable um accelerator composable Commerce accelerator Marcus please tell me if I'm right yeah absolutely fully and uh Tim and HRA thanks for having us today so maybe we just introduce ourselves with two words and then we step to the game uh yeah my name is Marcus found of driis beforehand I was working in an e-commerce sphere since years uh scaling also online F players on the merchant side um met Reinhardt since years and um funed detric and we're focusing on small and mediumsized Enterprises especially in the composable sphere and um HRA partner and that's why we are here today uh to show you what we bu in the P so to say and how we can leverage the market with our accelerator in that case and reard ni on news yeah yeah thanks um so my name is manard I'm C co-founder at drix and uh also many many years in e-commerce I think it should be 20 now or 20 so uh yeah I'm I'm really addicted to e-commerce and I think we can call it it's my passion yeah um yeah I'm very proud to be here so thanks for the invite and um yeah we will show you some cool stuff today yeah I'm really excited about it because of course we did a little bit of prep and I've been able to see it and I love how all the parts fit together to become something super flexible and I'm I'm really excited about a few parts but I won't say them now because we'll just see them in a sec I think what we should probably start with is Marcus and kind of let's get the story out of the way a little bit um for however long Market needs for this because it's really important to talk about where does this fit for whom is it how do you go there and then after that reinard and I will just dive super deep in some tech so um Marcus take it away please yeah absolutely so as we started in the whole e-commerce sphere um we stepped basically pretty early into the days of headless composability and so on so for so we made off first hatless project on Magento 2018 or something like that which was pretty early was that the time when Magento still had 800 queries on their homepage database yeah absolutely it could be yeah but uh what we would like to point out is it was quite a journey to build that kind of product or accelerator until now because what we see and um we have to be a little bit aware of all that marketing bullsh which is out on the market that composable composability is the holy gr so basically it's not yeah so on the one side it gives you a lot of flexibility but on the other side it's gives you a lot of um responsibility also to to deal with it properly to get the business upside out of it and that that's what we saw um the whole time and that's why we build the accelerator and um basically we ask ourselves always when it comes to composable Commerce why basically is it that hard to build composable Commerce and um I just picked out some some some topics which we see often like complex inte decoration requirements so if you have to build in CMS payment gateways pims and so on so far and you build that over and over and over again with different systems it's quite complex to connected to each other so uh if you switch back to a monolith there in that case uh you you do it once in the product uh development and then you have it can repeat it and basically those complex Integrations are killing projects or making projects more uh sophisticated or um yeah also from the coast side more affordable if you have kind of accelerator for it um especially what we also see is the customization complex complexity in that case um so what we see is that if you start composability from scratch no matter if you take Commerce tools Commerce layer whatsoever you have to build a kind of components libraries and components which you can use because basically you get a kind of framework of big Lego blocks where you can play Lego with it and so on so far um so this needs a bit of groundwork um which you can reuse in the in the end yeah and if you did that from scratch it's basically hard to do it yeah um Tim we also had a talk back in the past when it's called coupling about coupling about decoupling EXA yes exactly well we talked a lot about data uh data synchronization is um for sure another Topic in the composable world so connecting all the data from different sources um not only from Commerce Parts like the OM or the backend engine but also from the Legacy side is pretty hard in that case and getting this data together attaching it um working probably with the data defining the data schemas and so on so forth is also um an exercise which you not do that often and if you have something like an accelerator where you have a standard schema which you can extend you don't start at zero so you have kind of blueprint which you can nurture and use in that case and same is on performance optimization when it comes to the front end and um other topics of the application and of course what we also see if you really follow that path about full um composability you have several vendors which you have to play with yeah and maybe this is also something where we thought it makes sense to build a accelerate on that case because a quick question here so you're talking about the Lego pieces right and you're making something composable when you make an accelerator how much glue do you put in between the Lego pieces because there are people who actually never want their Lego pieces to fall and they will just glue them shut yeah exactly how did you make that decision because the thing we have also learned is people don't tend to change often once they choose yeah so how how did you think about that maybe we are going a bit further the argumentation line how we see composability um because if I go further and look um from the school book point of view on composability you have those uh capabilities in the Commerce sphere like product content Dum pricing payments subscriptions merch and so on and so for so a ton of capabilities which you have on the back end and you have to glue it to some extent to both your uh user experience and the front end decoupled by an API way on some for and we thought about it differently meaning um the marketing speech about composability is about that that you can just take the best of breed and take whatever you would like to want and so on so far but to be honest this is Premium League here yeah so if you are at that stage you're are really a mature organization with own Tech teams own product teams you were getting really the the last drop out of it and we thought why we shouldn't make it different so on the one side you have this old monolith which is still good because you have Allin one and on the other side you have that full fledged Commerce capabilities um maybe there's something in the middle and maybe this is answering also the the question to how we glue it together yeah and our assumption was basically the following so if we take two vendors um to build a kind of let's say building block orchestration on it then we glue those together within the front end but we're lean we're flexible and we're extendable so what we solve with that issue is basically giving the the merchant the ability to start quick and fast and you will dive later on with Reinhard all about the capabilities how we slice it and dice it yeah but based on those two Wenders like hgraph and commerce layer we're giving you as merchant the kind of starting point where we um fit the integration together but you're free um anytime if you evolve over the time time to say h maybe um let's say the um check out or the the promotion capability in Commerce layer is not the best which actually fits me so I would like to have something like I don't know tail and one or whatever really specialize in promotions in that case and uh extend that so this is basically the starting point yeah so this is uh to some extent glued together Ryan can answer later on a bit more on the technical how is it glued yeah um the starting point which you can use but you're always able to decouple it um over the apis and to use it in that case yeah basically that's uh how how we think composability in that case so um going back if you have that mass or that that ton of capabilities which is really hard to orchestrate uh then we thought hey let's make it easy um to GL it together and um yeah put everything together tomic's also here yeah it's nice to see some familiar faces it's always good yeah I think the the previous slide is a really interesting one where you can like because this is the thing that for me is always very interesting when you start and you might need one of those accelerators or whatever composable every company and the bigger they are the more complex it is they have a a dark corner somewhere with dirty data and there's a poor devops engineer that has to somehow optimize that and get it into the system and they all have it and so if you look at this slide that can fit in multiple places and you can kind of clean it up nicely right you can put it in the back end and use the event bus for it with third party stuff or in the API Gateway or like you have a lot of hooks into having that old stuff just living there and being able to kind of modernize it through these kind of systems and I think that's where this composable architecture can be super super interesting yeah and especially that was also for us the B on high graph because with high graph we're able to pet remote sources when it comes to data so exactly maybe looking at that schema um we were able just to fetch let's say the the price from the Erp system into biograph just as an weird example in that case or let's say the the stock or the description from an article we can just fetch it in high graph and from high graph uh we can fetch it from the front end so we're not doubling information we're just caching the information in high graph and CDN yeah and that's basically the beauty of that schema or of that um solution schema because then it's also like a migration path yeah so we're starting with high graph catching information build a new experience in the front end and it's not like standard projects so H oh we're not getting the data and we have to postpone the pro the full project because we're not able to to attach to Legacy systems in that case and that was basically the concept exactly and so the very important thing here if I can put a little CDA to high graph is that we don't actually clone the data at all we kind of just query it for you through a graphql interface called content Federation but then storing that um on the CDN Edge as cash so the system still lives on its own and so even if you looked at this one you could put the Commerce layer information into high graph and then only query High graph if you wanted to in your case you might do it differently because that's what hatas is all about you can choose it yourself yeah and I would say also the beauty of let's say uh staying the subsystems or the legacies attack independent is the the secret source to do the transformation part because you're just cutting out the dependencies as well on a technical level as well on as on organizational level and can really move on Project exactly um is there anything else we should talk about on this kind of overview side or should we dive into some um die hard tech yeah mostly maybe some uh uh words about how you should move in a kind of composable project because this is also something which we are getting asked so how you getting from A to B and I would say here our experience just comes into place because we work also on the on the merchant side many years and built online C players so we have a hard glimpse of how you move from A to B um and what what's needed for that and um what we see is that many many agencies are pitching uh hey you have to go composable fully fledged and will solve all your issues and basically this is not really the case yeah to stay humble here you have this month which is making basically a good job yeah and if you have um topics why you should move to a composable architecture because you're unique or your processes are super unique or you multibrand multi Warehouse whatsoever strategy then it makes sense to move into such a peer yeah with the multi Channel approaches and so on so far but the way to go up from our side is really building at the beginning a kind of takeover phase where you go from the monolithic architecture into a micro service field let's say it like that so we're building to two new services or what whatsoever new Services side yeah using them alongside with the um with the uh monolith in that case uh and then we're moving forward so we're really decoupling smoothly the whole monolith um to get to that composable architecture on the right and and this just transform phase is basically then readjusting all the building blocks and what's really important is that this is kind of yeah it's ongoing Tech transformation yeah you're not doing that Snappy as as this one rather having a plan where are you right now what are the business goals why you should do composable um what are the first steps on this journey yeah because it's not a project which is finished it's like a journey where you have to go this path uh and then um make this ongoing Tech transformation happen on that case but that's basically uh within the first 15 minutes just for the general overview we're happy to discuss that with all the people outside um also we were happy to getting challenged and yeah we need some questions and and and answers soon when we start to show more Tech the thing is though I want to emphasize this slide because it's probably the most important slide because what it does is it kind of highlights that you probably need an agency to do this transformation because agencies do this thing really well and if you want to do this as a brand alone and you have a tech internal Tech Team it's really really hard to figure out when to do what and how to choose what and so this is where basically you you might sell your accelerator here but you bring the people that know how to implement it and do this thing and that's where it's a big Worth to have Partnerships like ours where we can all put in the people because we've done this before and with that in mind we can say to potential customers are like okay we we see what you're struggling with we have done this let's do it in a way that is good for you and then you can show multiple flavors of this thing and I've done this before I worked at startups at agency and it it would be a four-year project you better have an agency there to kind of help you and you know choose the right things and so it's cool to see that there's now accelerators that kind of fit this model so awesome stuff thank you so much Marcus yeah always welcome um so Reinhardt did you have a specific slide you wanted to start on yeah I think uh we have an overview here about the techical building blocks of the accelerator maybe you can show us this one oh this one here we go yeah exactly exactly so uh yeah we've we've learned a lot in in the last slides and we've seen what uh what we can offer from the capability point of view but uh yeah let's stick a bit deeper into the text stuff yeah um and uh I wanted to give you a quick overview of what is included from the technical point of view because there is a really a lot of cool stuff here um yeah so our foundation and system of choice here is uh is HRA for data management um that means that we are not only doing all the typical stuff like maintaining let's say page data for some campaign Pages or any pages in hgraph um we are also maintaining product content in hgraph uh for some clients um with some requirements we are maintaining all the data or all the history data in hgraph um you have all the certifications like sucku Ty and and such kind of things so uh that that can easily be done uh with permissions and dedicated API keys this is this is all secure uh so we really like the flexibility here um of high graph and at the end everything else we will see here in the next boxes is is connected to data you know so this is very important and as I said our foundation yeah uh yeah next topic of course uh no e-commerce without a web application yeah so uh we believe in in react and next Jaz here as uh Technologies and um yeah we provide um let's say application here um with all the configured Pages for routing um was predefined the main structure um we are using incremental static regeneration um means that we are using static Pages uh combined with Dynamic uh Dynamic contact UM to benefit from from its performance at the end and uh also the application is uh full of stuff like s generation uh automatic SE data on product pages and such kind of things so and I guess it's multilang and all that age all stuff that you don't want to build it's there yeah it's simply there um I mean we are building every client is different somehow yeah but at the end you're building multiple uh Ecommerce application for all of them yeah and they require a base stack of features um which is nearly the same of course you have somehow SEO experts who think something should be different then you can adjust it but is is a good foundation and a good Bas to start and there's definitely accelerator is you know especially on how if you have like a master variant and you're showing sub variants how do you do that for SEO and in my career I've had like four approaches to that and they're all different and I hated all of them like some even had like a hashbang in the URL with like it was a hashbang in the URL with a with a subvariant number that we then change in JavaScript so Google wouldn't pick it up and then they they would notice that you did that and then throw you back in the SEO lower and oh my God so soon when you show this I want to see how you do it and I imagine there's some accessibility stuff as well in there that is like quite mature yeah that's uh that's let's say something we need to improve honestly um there will also be a change from the legal requirements uh for next year so shops uh required to taught some uh some uh some basics in this area of accessibility and uh yeah that's is something which is which is currently on our road map yeah yeah it's like some Code Compliance at least so you need to be AA I guess yeah okay so what else do we have yeah uh next thing and maybe that's uh that's very special regarding the philosophy we are using here the Commerce components uh that means that uh from our philosophy we try to decouple the functional elements of our application with the visual part uh we will dig a bit deeper into that uh in a minute because for the visual part we're using a visual Builder application um called plasmic and in our react application we are using only functional components they typically does not include any Design Elements like CSS classes and so on okay you will see that a minute very very interesting and uh that of course gives you gives us very huge flexibility for clients which have a multibrand strategy or multi-shop strategy because they can use the uh reuse the uh the functional elements and put every design on it um as I like so the front end app in nextjs is basically functional components with just functionality and data which is then exactly matched into plasmic and there you design how it looks and does plasmic then serve the pages or is that only like how how is how the pages served the pages are served by the next year as application we host it uh typically on versal you know so we can also benefit here from uh font optimization or image optimization everything buil inside inversal um that's pretty nice and uh during the page building process on the server side at versal the design and the design elements are fetched from from plasmic combined on the serice side and during this the static build of the pages um this is handled and then delivered and sered to the clients cool and so is that running on the edge or is it in a serverless function sorry I'm going to go right in I'm going to ask all the this is uh from the Versa perspective it's uh this page building is running on the edge yeah okay cool um yeah one topic we we already discussed um integration um this is definitely if you do it for the first time uh we've seen many clients trying that on their own it's very timec consuming and challenging uh we believe here in an event driven architecture uh we use I think that's that's pretty flexible in a system where we have to do with uh with a lot of Zas toolings yeah and um as I said We Believe here in event driven architecture where we provide a pre-configured uh Kafka environment um with pre-installed topics and and event schemas for all those common data entities let's say in the e-commerce area uh could be an order of course product the customer um all that that kind of things yeah huge benefit definitely at the end um yeah based on this uh this event stream of course I've already said we have to do with a lot of Zas toolings uh there is always a challenge do they support some kind of un streaming yeah basically they have something but they are following their own principles uh some solutions like HRA has web hooks uh to deal with that uh some others have their own type of event stream others only have an HTTP API and uh in in our composable uh Commerce environment we um we have to connect them all together yeah with the event stream and therefore we have a huge set of integration Services who communicate from the event bus at the end uh to the dedicated system um and translate everything transform some data and uh and publish them to to the events and uh I think that's in our standard stack it's around 20 to 30 uh Services included here it sounds like you're pitching a new startup idea I see Marcus's faed not again no but there's a gap in our market for this part and that's where companies like otu and cania and they're all jumping on this bit and this is a very interesting part of composable yeah uh we see it very often that uh I mean other agencies uh uh have a very limited scope on the ecomerce system uh the ecomerce system only maybe CMS part is isn't included there very often these days but but we think it get a bit bigger yeah there are lots of other uh systems also involved it could be the E system on the client side could be some system from the invoicing could be a logistics system uh micr like some in store stuff right you want to go some some point of sales application or something like exactly and uh as I said we thinking get a bit bigger everything needs to be connected at the end and therefore we are providing that uh event driven architecture system and we do not limit our clients here that means that we are not putting that into the scope of e-commerce that's fully open for the clients so if they identify that this could be the architecture or the way to go for other Solutions on their side as well they can use our Humanes infrastructure they can use the event driven uh uh the event bus with kafa it's not limited they can use it and oh that's very cool happy to to see that yeah and so do you tend to or are you probably flexible but do you tend to host this um on the customer infrastructure or do you say here we have this you pay us a license and we just put it on here yeah um we set up an infrastructure um or tooling around that using kubernetes everything is kubernetes ready we have a lot of Open Source Tools in our stack like raana promeo for mon tracing we're using a keilas for example for secret management there is a lot of other stuff included there um the clients have no venol lock yeah we are providing an infrastructure offering yeah that's that's for sure but uh there is nothing special about us um if the clients have I don't know one of the big hyperscalers where they're hosting everything they are free to do so or they can do it on their own but we will provide something uh some software tooling here we happy to offer that uh I mean we have some support packages and so as well on that infrastructure so the client definitely have some some benefits of using our infrastructure but the important part here is the clients have no vendor lock yeah they can they can switch any time they can use uh maybe for specific building block something differently um that's totally up to them yeah we see that really often in projects where clients are stuck to agencies who are building just a tech um on their side so that you have a quite window lock and then basically it comes to the situation you don't want long uh want don't want to work longer with the agency and try to get out of that trap and then it's start to getting nasty in that case and this situation are putting our clients into the comfortable situation that they always can take out the whole infrastructure go to the wender hyperscale of Jo just can run it there um this is one topic and the other topic is it put us uh a little bit under Fire or in that position that we always have to strive to be really experts and excellent for that yeah so that there is no uh chance for the or what means chance that there is no uh moment where the client has to think I would would like to to switch the hosting or something like that yeah and uh what we're also doing is um maybe this is a little bit unusual um with every paid in we're uh mirroring the full code and the database to the clients so that they have always full confidence that they have what they paid and they Al always can just get the plug out in that case yeah so it's very interesting to see this because this is also something which we see then the client has an accessible accessibility to code or IP on the code and something like that and it just gives the clients trust um that we're working with open openminded um routs in that case and we strive for the best which we can do yeah I think this is very nice to see because lots of agencies want to be remain sticky as possible and therefore have very complicated setups and force people to do certain things that then work for a year but when you mature or grow suddenly it doesn't work anymore you have to pay the agency more is is complicated so I I love seeing the flexibility um Reinhard shall we show some code or maybe some examples at least to get started yeah I've uh I've prepared a small Journey um based on some product data um yeah to show you how I'm just putting it on the screen here exactly all over the systems which are involved here um especially High graph classic the visual Builder and then how it looks like in code and now we can yeah we can extend something yeah um okay um what we can see here is uh typical uh High graph interface with all the data models here um I want to focus mostly on the product today but uh we also have models here for uh for the brand or uh for the homepage for the navigation to influence that or content post to build some kind of blog or Magazine on a page which uh which can be maintained by some editors um yeah let's but let's dig into the uh the product model a bit um to give you the yeah some basic information to understand what we will see in in the next phases uh with classic and at the end in code um so here we are in an example product um on the root level of course we have some typical attributes so I don't need to say so much about this so we have a naming we have a slack we have a description which is typically in place for let's say every product which is sure in the database uh we maintain a separate image for for listing Pages or maybe for gallery sliders something like this yeah then we have all the images on the uh on the detail page um this is something we separate uh we have somehow product list can also show you later how they are used in uh in plasmic um this is basically a flat list of products uh you want to put together somehow could be accessories could be some kind of categories how to bundle them uh this can be done with product list so this is very flexible there is a more generic thinking behind it yeah so could this be something like hey for Christmas we're going to make a list of things to buy for your mom and this could be one of those lists in that context yeah if it's uh could be um if it's very limited yeah if it's a more bigger list I would I would say it's it could be more or less uh an assortment yeah okay assortments are much much bigger these are more some kind of cataloges yeah where I can create for example in that case here we see that we have a specific assortment for b2c clients yeah there could be an additional assortment for B2B clients so product lists are from the from the philosophy more uh more lean let's say if you have 10 15 products maybe you want show as some kind of accessory uh accessory then it makes sense to use the product list yeah cool um yeah I already told something about the assortment this is some tooling you can create uh cataloges could be b2c could be uh B2B as a explain but maybe if you are in the fashion industry it could be your summer assortment or it could be your winter assortment and what's pretty cool about assortments is that uh if you want if you want to put a product online that it's visible and buyable at the end yeah uh we are not assigning products directly to the markets or to the websites uh this all is handed by the assortment so you always have to assign the the product to the assortment and then you can uh uh you can assign the assortment to that specific market and of course that could be multiple assortments you are assigning and uh yeah we have customers for example using those assortments and uh startler features like the releases and scheduling of uh um of HRA uh to maintain their seasonality yeah so in summer they have the summer assortment and they can uh during the winter season they can prepare everything um it often takes a lot of a lot of time and then after they finished all the assortment then they can schedule it for I don't know first of March or so uh that it goes online and they com can combine that with with content Pages or landing pages they put it in the same release and uh publish it on a specific date so I mean if you think about the standard e-commerce uh solution or even about the composable solution um and think about flesh sales yeah so uh at midnight 12:00 you put on the assortment with that content blocks and so on so far you have to do a lot and even in 2024 systems are not super ready for that to to have content and the catalog time controlled there yeah and here we have the beauty that we combine those two worlds yeah this is where you see that HRA is really into like really good data management and permissions and who can release what when all that stuff is a big focus on high grive and that's what I'm I love seeing how well you guys use all these features that's super awesome um yeah thanks sure um yeah then we have a brand assignment uh it's not used very often but it's uh it's sub entity here if you want to build up some some brand Pages uh for example or show up a logo for all the PDP for a particular brand um then of course you can use it it's part of or standard data model um then we have a specification set or sometimes also another e-commerce solution called attribute sets or something like this um this uh differs your product types at the end yeah so uh for example if you have Electronics you have uh um maybe tools something like this and uh for example uh for electrical stuff you need an Energy Efficiency label or classification d you can put it into the specification set for this and assign everything you need to that particular product and um yeah also we see here variant so you can have in the very simple model a t-shirt in different sizes or different colors and through the applic through the specification set you can also override attributes which are on the variant level so uh for example if you have a light yeah you have you have a version uh with a more vage on uh or more power on it uh then for example it could happen that it's that it's bigger for for the diameter diameter or it has more light sources in it and then it's it's required to override some some specifications maybe yeah um yeah this is basically how it looks like on the data side and uh a quick question here if I want to make a product page of course I'm going to grab this data but what if I also let's say it's about like some fashion thing they tend to love to show behind the scenes how this bag was made so there might be a little video there might be some extra copy how do I add that to this yeah uh in that case uh for example to add a video it could be made by uh adding a specific attribute here where you can place the the video asset for example or or it could also be part of the brand page yeah so uh maybe it's something generic how I don't want to name some some brand here but let's say how a big fashion brand is is working it's more brand video then you can put it on a brand page and reference uh to that on the PDP yeah there are multiple options I would say that and uh yeah that's flexibility we have also the beauty again that we can use HRA as well for the assets um AKA videos pictures on that and just display it in the front end so that makes it Beauty in that case yeah yeah great so uh yeah then let's jump over to uh to another tool here as we said we're separating design and functionality yeah this is a tool called plas we're using for maintaining the design creating the design and uh let's give you a short overview about the tool itself you so uh maybe you're already seen that here in the Central Area um yeah we see the whole page how it's rendered we see it in different uh break points yeah wow um we see yeah how it looks like and on the left side uh we see a representation of this page in some kind of D Tre let's say yeah looks like a file explorer um we have all the the elements here uh we're going to dig a bit deeper here into the h one tag for example this pops up uh so you see more details and you can navigate here in in that tree for all of the elements here you see that it's it's popping up uh where I'm are with the with the cursor um on the right side it's very important here um you have all the settings where you maintain let's say at the end your CSS classes yeah you define your a your font size uh you define your colors your spacings margins and everything you you know so where do you define this can a Content editor without any knowledge of accessibility make a yellow header on a red background um I think you should should have some uh some basic knowledge uh definitely yeah um you can Define what a Content editor can do yeah that's good honestly for for this tooling there are different price tiers and of course Enterprise you can do most of the stuff and uh I can Define which each of those sections here the content editor is able to see yeah so I can say hey should the content editor be able to adjust the size for example or how the tag is rendered this is typically something I don't want to uh don't want to have a Content editor this sometimes not sometimes search engine stuff and so behind you can damage something at the end yeah um yeah that that can be defined on a very granular level what you what you want to have a Content editor to do and so here in the content field where you were just were there so it says whe com and by datrix is that some content that is typed in here or does that come from hgraph this is currently a Content which uh which comes from here yeah from plasmic um we separate typically between content which needs to be adaptive because you have uh you have editors working on that and on the other half you have content which is uh which is more statically um it could be that for example you have Dynamic content which should be shown up here then we can create something uh so this is maintainable in high graph currently this is uh this is coming from plasmic in this example yeah I'm always asking this one because there's um a complicated distinction between domain data and volatile data and your domain data lives in high graph because that's where it's extremely good at but your FAL data like this it might not say will Common next week it might say good evening next week or whatever something personalized or something completely different and so volatile data should maybe not be in the CMS in this instance but it's much easier to type it in here yeah yeah yeah especially if it's more constant and uh and not Dynamic at the end but it's depends on the customer what what do yeah exactly uh some some customers only want to have the shop to have the products online they don't have editors who take care about contents they don't have some kind of blog or something exactly is dynamic they have more or less a standard shop yeah yeah I've worked for customers that didn't want content editing because their agency would Design This is what that page looks like for these three months and you just build it no content editing this is it we do all languages in one week and then that's it and so you have to be flexible when you do an accelerator like this yeah definitely um yeah that that kind of stuff can be done here on the on this right sidebar and um let's have a look because we've seen that product data before um this was this chair maybe you recognize I do um excuse me I've I've seen that morning that most of the texts here are in German language ah there's no problem enough to understand it exactly um so for that example if I click into that here with the double click um what you can do what we've seen here is that this is uh this is defined here as a reusable component yeah so defined once and then with a right click you can combine that or group those uh so it can be reused on other Pages as well um to modify those it's uh it's pretty easy to double click here and then all everything pops up and if I adjust something here um then this uh this changes is uh is taken to all of the other Pages where this is okay so it's a reusable component so if you make this black text now it's black everywhere it's black everywhere exactly okay cool um okay what we see here on uh in the D now let's let's have a look on this so we see here some components uh with drix uh in its name yeah it's thatx product description it's thatx product title here's a price container but the most important stuff uh currently uh is the dric product container here we have a couple of components uh which are named with uh yeah with this term container and uh that means that they are mostly used for for data fetching so this container now is responsible for fetching the product data from igraph okay that case and uh let's take a look at what we can uh what we can set here on this uh on this component so we have three properties here um first there is a preview slack uh this is set yeah then we have a slack this is unset um I will explain you in a second why and then there is also a main product uh is main product booing attribute and uh what that means is that uh at the end we're defining here a dynamic page yeah we see now this particular share but it is a dynamic page we're designing here so we need to Define which product we want to fetch here to show show up in the editor and uh that's what the previous slck is used for so typically in in most companies there are three four five specific products where you know from previous project hey these are your bad guys let's say yeah horrible dat now let's see yeah exactly yeah exactly and then you can use those uh those particular products yeah so it's not my design plasmic so in plasmic you cannot browse all your products you basically browse a product page or a PDP and then you add the preview lugin to at least get some data on how that template looks that's what we're looking exactly exactly it's not like I'm browsing the site and I'm editing what I see I'm actually editing my templates and I need some preview data to be able to know how this will look with this amount of data that's what this CL does okay cool yeah yeah definitely cool and uh this gives also um huge benefit for designers for example yeah um this UI here is very similar to toolings like figma yeah and if a designer is get some kind of introduction to this tooling the designer is able to adjust something here and uh the huge benefit here is that the designer don't need to work with mock data yeah uh like like in case like figar he can work already with real data and make his design adjustments on the page and thatly show how it looks like I mean every one of us who built that once yeah who go once through this process I might designer to a developer uh uh you will know that at the end I don't know the image as ratio is different uh the length of the product description is different exact page is broken it doesn't look like from doesn't match to the original design 100% let's and with that you can directly see how it will look like and that's a huge benefit in our opinion we're also cutting a bit the process so that you don't need this um daisy chain like designer front end developer back end developer and so on so far so basically the designer could just design everything what he or she would like to design directly in plasmic and the components are ready and you can direct drop them uh and basically you have fully functional code out of it or working website quick question here let's say I'm a huge brand and I have an agency working on my design my component Library my design language my whole system how does that work with this can you implement whatever components they have already into this um there are importers from uh from f for example yeah so they this brand has everything at figar um it's possible to import things honestly speaking to import a whole page at once is really a pain yeah uh no but you just do it component by component and then do it exactly you can do component by component then you have some autogenerated stuff like naming then for this component you have I don't know three two four names you can adjust and then you can you can do it component by component and uh create the page that way yeah and folks as we have just 10 minutes left I would like to scope the angle a bit also on the on the Commerce components which are integrated into plasmic uh so that we're getting the audience uh at the end to the fully working website so that we can from high graph to the visual design um reflecting the code components which we have in here where doing things like at card and so on so far so see I would love Yeah I have like a thousand more questions I will hold off the one thing I want to see is what code comes what comes out of this and how does that become a website like is there something you can show us maybe in FS code or something about what comes out of this to then make it de side and also as a web developer myself can I then change whatever CSS plasmic added to this because I might not like it and then after that I want to see the full flow so like Marcus said like we can click buttons and actually see it work yeah yeah I can show it um so let me quickly finish uh this container components so uh we have seen here uh we have here a couple of properties and this is totally up to the developers which properties Pro to provide here yeah and what needs to be controlled by this component uh I will show you that in a minute in in vs code and these container components are basically built up on based on react context and uh they control all the data here and then we have the sub elements here for example in that case the product title the product description which show some data and uh these are pretty easy components which accesses the context at the end yeah and uh renders uh the text in that case yeah and they can fully you can fully design everything here um all you to to make them appear um as you like yeah okay then then uh let me quickly change my screen to vs code I think you might have to just reshare something else yeah I think I I need to reshare just remove this one and then you can reshare yeah exactly yeah I kind of I'm quite interested to see that you basically cut out the front end developer by a lot which is interesting if it works it's a lot cheaper and a lot less complaining for all that standard stuff let's say yeah yeah for all the basics need developers uh for sure uh to maintain that stuff and uh yeah there are lot of individual stuff for each client to build course um yeah but why to reinvent the wheel every time yeah and that's something tot cut out yeah um so my screen share now right so quickly let's quickly jump to the to the container component so you can see how it looks like oh yeah basically what we see here at the end is a very simple standard react functional component in that Library so it's uh product container and what we see here is also that we have this interface defined and here you remember all the property we had in plas yeah the previous SL the slack and the the Boolean property here is main product um and of course we have the children and then we have a very small um small jsx here uh which renders a product provider and this is the the context element and inside of this context element um yeah it's huge it's combined some some functionality here to track Google analytics stuff but what we see here is that the query here for the product is defined yeah so the graph cry um the data is fetched here and then here the um the JX for the product container context is is rendered yeah and um so uh children can access this um this contact data so all this information is passed to the children basically exactly exactly yeah and using react contacts so you don't need this drop uh prop drilling yes as before I think it was around announc in react 16 yeah with the context yes so it's much much easier to work yeah um to work for us and that kind of tooling here and then we have the product description um which was one of the sub elements we have seen in plasmic um and in that case what is very important here to connect now plasmic with with the code component is just a simple thing you have to Define and your interface a class name and what plasmic does it also generates a CSS class for you depending on what you've set in your properties on the right side and then this autogenerated class name is injected here to this property so it can be used here anywhere in your jsx uh in that case there is a main diff container um at the beginning which which WPS it which at the class name it's also possible to Define multiple class uh classes in plasmic um so you can put them somewhere different for example I can put them here in this uh this FR yeah exactly um this is possible but this is more complex of course yeah basically it's just re like this will not add a div right on the line 21 it's just another yeah yeah exactly yeah and this is how it looks like and then to have this kind of functional component here available in plasm there is an SDK included here uh which is on the app page or on the pages folder this is a higher order component for plasmic which takes care of uh of the connection at the end um but we will need to provide uh some kind of metadata and this is what we see here yeah um and this provides the information for for plasmic how this component should look like yeah so there is a name and in case you have specific properties we can see that here on the product container um there we have this properties configured here um how they should look like on plasmic side so which data type they should have um that case is shield on the slot so we can maintain sub elements here um where in that case it's Boo this is great so you're basically informing plasmic code first what it should show exactly that is cool I was not expecting that I thought you had to then click and drag a lot in plas set it up and then hopefully get that down to your code base with some CLI or something but it's actually oh that's awesome it's the other direction end great so you as a developer can choose this is what plasmic sees exactly nice okay that now it makes more sense now okay this is great yeah I I have a thousand questions I'm not going to ask because we have four minutes um should we maybe um if you wanted of course rinard finish up a little bit in what you wanted to say here but maybe let's have a look at like what this website actually looks like and how the flow looks um you mean the whole website let me check if that works yeah because we have all these integration related things right because we're going to have to like add to card and do login or whatever I I'll remove the screen so you can put your browser back on quickly check if that builds currently because it's running oh here we go yeah because um while we wait Marcus maybe you can talk a little bit about how Commerce layer is connected here yeah basically we um as we saw on plasmic before um that we have components for hgraph we have also components for Commerce layer like at two card or fetch prices or fetch inventory um which basically comes from Commerce layer in that case and then you as a designer can just uh get the components from hgraph or Comm layer orchestrated from the functionality point of view um and it lose together there yeah so that's basically what what's happening in that case and oh that's awesome so it's a very similar approach with these container components MH in plasmic I love that we're on Local Host now it works that's cool it works definitely B go to versal or in in production mostly of the time in production it's it's on versal for he just had for saleev and so probably is running through for sales um infrastructure now anyways right [Music] um no I think it's is there something where it connected no I think it's totally Local Host oh this is okay okay cool um maybe the images I'm not sure let me Imes are fetched from uh from V but yeah doesn't matter doesn't matter for now um yeah so this is at the end the the PDP page which results showcase application uh here this uh at card button uh in the VAR um is used here um this is a library we use from Commerce layer which provides this react Library oh nice with all the functional components they share a bit all the philosophy to separate the functionality from the design but they do it more on the code side yeah and what we do is we wrap somehow their components and uh wrap it into plasma components so it can be easily adapted to uh to the way um of we are working yeah that's cool and uh yeah in that show in that showcase here I'm using also something which is uh which is pretty nice uh which also comes from comers layer they have a couple of they call it hosted applications they are very generic when it comes to their um to the brand identity let's say it's mhm it's black and white but in a modern style yeah sure this is integrated into the application oh is is an frame it's hosted on their side yeah it's in an if frame oh I love this this is very smart now you don't have to build this exactly you have better the time to Market care about exactly how the products are presented and then you can use something standardized uh for the checkout process and for the car process I love this model and more companies should do it it's kind of funny right so you're fully headless Mac Alliance all the things yeah and then turns out that's really hard to build yourself and so why not just make something based on a little origin um that everybody can use and suddenly is much more successful like this thing Shopify is the same thing big Commerce yeah shop Shopify looks nearly the same yeah exactly yeah I noticed that no but this is great so you didn't have to build this yeah customer don't have to pay for it how does it work and this is my last question because I've worked on this kind of stuff back in the day so we didn't have these services so I had to build a checkout for 60 markets or some no like 30 markets 60 languages ridiculous all with different ways of how do you log in how do you store your whatever phone number all that what if you get a big customer like that that is demanding in the UK the street has to be like this and then in Germany it's going to be like that and how does that all work the does commerce layer just offer you this and if they they're not you just ask them or would you then build it yourself yeah this this requires some some customization to do that um it not comes from the hosted application part but it's totally open source you can just for the app oh nice you can do your changes here and uh find a way how to uh yeah how to implement this uh the specific uh topics for for the country in that case open source is just magical isn't it this is great guys I we are a little yeah exactly we are a little overtime mostly my fault because I have too many questions I have a lot more but maybe we can do a V2 at one point um thank you so much both of you for joining us and showing us this magic and I'm really hoping um you get to to to be able to show a bunch of this stuff live if it's running already and if you have something that's in production on this feel free to share that in our chat but as far as I know this is still quite new right yeah but we have two projects basically um on production right now so we're working actually on the case study so that we can publish it um but everyone who would like to know more about it um just be open connect us on LinkedIn or over in that case and we can show you the live project as well yeah and you can actually go in into you can see the the little ticker below here on the screen can go to d.com accelerators and then composable and what is it composable Commerce that makes a lot of sense and we can Al oh we have it both now it's also in the chat so it's easier to click on the link there so thank you guys so much I am really excited by the model that you have used and I think this plasmic thing that separates out the whole design business from the real Data Business that means it's ready for scale and this is cool and I hadn't used something like that that way so I'm pretty intrigued to figure out how you did it so Reinhardt expect some questions soon um thank you so much both and is there um a last word you guys want to share maybe Marcus or Reinhardt go for it if not it's time good all right beer time it is cheers guys thank you so much and um thanks everyone studio just yet by the way um cheers everyone bye cheers bye I just clicked end stream"
