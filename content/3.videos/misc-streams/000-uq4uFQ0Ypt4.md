description: "Remember the US sitcom Married with Children? In this week's episode of Dare Dialogues, Tim and Leoni explore the relationship between PR and DevRel (Developer Relations). While PR might be seen as a dirty word in the developer world, there are fundamental similarities between the two. The core principles are the same, even though the materials, channels and audiences differ. It's all about building relationships and effective communications."
