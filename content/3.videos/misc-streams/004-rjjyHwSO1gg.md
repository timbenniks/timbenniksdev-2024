title: "Customer Story: How to Create AI Videos for B2B Content Marketing"
description: "Videos are a highly engaging and dynamic medium that can effectively capture and retain the attention of B2B audiencesâ€”allowing businesses to convey complex information visually appealing and concisely, making it easier for customers to understand their products or services. They also help build trust, as B2B purchases often involve significant investments and long-term commitments. Video marketing enables companies to showcase their expertise, demonstrate their products in action, and provide customer testimonials, which help build trust and credibility with potential buyers.\nHeyGen is a b2b solution that allows customers to create AI videos at scale. Fast and affordable, saving your team time and money. No camera, no crew, no problem.\n\nThe webinar will be a live interview where our CEO and Co-Founder, Josh Xu, will discuss a customer success story with Tim Benniks, who created an Avatar Lite using HeyGen AI technology, became a brand ambassador, and developed a b2b marketing strategy for his company.     \n\nTake advantage of this exciting and informative live and interactive webinar. We will also be giving a five-minute credit to attendees to start creating AI videos at scale. Join us and discover the power of HeyGen AI.\n\nWhen: Thursday, July 27, 11:00 am PST/ 2:00 pm EST"
