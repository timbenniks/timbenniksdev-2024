transcript: "please continue [Laughter] this is what we need we need some lovely discussions about really cool keyboards look at that one okay so now that we're starting real life now what is this show me that's a keyboard oh wow look at that one wow that's nice okay i i'm not i don't want to show mine now i have one that i can show look at the customer how did you did you get this from uh was asd keyboards no because the shipping was twice as expensive as the keyboard itself yeah understandable let me see how you draw it did you did you draw it onto it like no no i made an svg that was exactly that and i sent it to a guy on etsy who is in the uk uh okay that's who printed it for me just one and he died it's like 23 bucks or something and then he sent it to me for another 23 and then i had to pay import costs because it's uk and i could have bought a new keyboard for just that one little oh [\___\_] yeah anyways doesn't matter um i'll make a quick tweet about the fact that we're live let's see if somebody feels like joining us yeah i'm also tracking some questions uh if we have any yeah so i have a few here in the sidebar that i can just pop up like this and then we can chat about it but some are like really stupid because i don't actually know them know the answers and you guys probably do and so um maybe what we can start with is you guys both show me what keyboard you're using right now and then what it actually is and then probably i have a ton of questions about that so maybe uh consonant how about you start all right so er mine is uh basically ansi so it's a qwerty ansi so which means that basically i have an enter a key which is not like a big l-shaped like the frog it's just the the the the small one right the thinner the the thick long one um yeah basically it's like some american classic that you'll find pretty easily i don't have any kind of keycaps i mean any kind of lettering on it so it's just blank and it's a hhkb profile also meaning that basically i don't have a control key because i use basically caps lock for that and yeah it comes from japan it's pretty nice pretty lightweight it's like plastic yeah it's quite small actually i put some damp on in it i put a custom battery in it so basically i can use bluetooth with it uh it's not mandatory to be wired um yeah what else to say so yeah so uh to start this is not like uh using uh mechanical switches because this is top ray uh so this is some kind of exception let's say okay uh so it's not like the best keyword showcase actually so this is not actually a mechanical keyboard yeah it's part of the mechanical well keyboard because for example you have your usual cherry switches so for example any brown or ductile speed reds or whatever but this is like uh on the other side because for example the old ibm keyboards got some buckling springs which were basically like uh yeah making a current spring and this is like top ray so top rate it's a mix between membrane and mechanical switch with also um some kind of spring but it's not like metallic so it's perfect because it's heavy and when you type on it and at the same time it's super smooth and it's silent and the feeling is quite unique you don't have a lot of top ray because you cannot build your own top ray it needs to be like i mean you can buy a keyboard and then hack it but it's not like you can buy any kind of case or pcb and switch and then mix it so yeah it's kind of yeah an exotic underdog exotic and underdog but that's probably part of people love that stuff i guess yeah and also it's like super affordable uh because it's like 300 euros and you can get it like um you just said it's like 300 that's not cheap right or is it but i mean for mechanical keyboard it's uh cheap still okay okay good to know um that's also a question we we might get into later on because uh like if we talk about costs in a mechanical keyboard environment we are totally out of reach for for any normal customer when he buys a logitech something yeah because i bought this like years ago this is a logitech gaming keyboard and they say it's i think it's actually probably it has these fancy switches this blue something i think but this cost like 100 bucks yeah and but is that worth it like i don't like it actually i'm not using it i just put it here because we have this stream so it's like hey i can show you this crappy thing is this like average quality is that good enough or do you need to go higher and buy something fancy like you have constantly um it depends i mean i bought this one because i really wanted to try to pray but at the same time it's not like really mandatory because you can also go for a keyboard that is around 120 or 150 it's also totally feasible because you have like the gaming brand so corsair or logitech or whatever and they are doing some keyboards that are mostly proprietary meaning that you cannot really change the keycaps or mud it or flash it easily or even sometimes not at all and yeah so i was just on the trip uh to japan and i thought all right let's bring some souvenir from japan and so i took that from there but i bought this mainly because it's like super lightweight it's plastic it's not like one of the most expensive that you can have with full cnc the aluminium um so yeah for me it's just like nice to have but you can also totally either order one or make one yourself for like 80 euros maybe 120. so it's the same prices logitech um but since you do that yourself uh you could put like some better switches or put your own lube i mean your own keycaps basically anything that you you want um yeah it's just a matter of your budget so one of the things to consider at first is all right so how at max can i put into a mechanical keyboard that way yeah it's it helps quite a lot uh to like get a range of choices yeah so janos what are you rocking today i am i can show you i switch the camera and i have to look around my cam to see where i can choose the next cam wait i'm like behind your screen somehow yeah it's somewhere there there we go okay so what i have here sorry it's pretty exotic looking it is and it is not because um we we all know the the logitech no it was the microsoft uh ergonomic keyboard which was also like a split design but also like a big wave on your on yeah and someone told we told you that it's so good to to type on but it was never from my point of view i could never type on it um so this is more like a alice type layout some call it an alice layout but and the original alice layout which has a history had no arrow keys and also no macros on the side of it so it's more like a rusi or i don't know i didn't even know what's the other um um yeah word for that but it's let's say it an alice typed layout and it's uh as as you see kind of split in the middle it has double b's so there's a b on this side and then on this side so you can type the b with either thumb you have also the split um spacebar and it it does something it does that your hands move a little bit to the to another angle so it is more comfortable to type um this one is called the kikron q8 and it came out around a week ago or so i also did a video on that on my channel and kikron is uh supporting me and my my keyboard stuff on my on my channel and sending me all the new keyboards in advance so that's a really really a really nice position where i'm in that i have all those kikron q series boards and the k series boards at home to test and try and to see what it is like so this is also a fully cnc body so this is full aluminum um i did no modding on it and modding is a big topic inside of mechanical keyboard stuff constantine just said he he did some some tape inside of it so you basically the first thing you do you put some tape on the back of the pcb like on the on the on the plate itself uh where the where the switches are on you put some some dampening tape um under it and then you can also there's also something like a like a force break because on those um fully cnc aluminum bodies you have like a top uh case and a bottom case and you don't want to have the sound of of the inside so you do a force break where you just put something in between the cases so when you type on it that there's no hollow sound like it is here yeah so there's so many so many mods that you can think about that you can do with your with your keyboard yeah but you probably need like a more fancy keyboard to be able to take it apart like that and do that stuff right well it's it's pretty easy to take these parts like if we're talking about mechanical keyboards and mechanical keyboards normally if they have gasket mount designed which is another topic we should talk about but uh here like all those few screws you just put out these screws and you can access everything um and the pcb and the plate are just sitting on on top of the bottom case and you can just take them out it's pretty easy hey i'm just we're getting a whole bunch of comments so i'm just putting them here oh look at this for the french people that speak french they know this is a very nice message or very cheeky anyways and i'm the lovely yes okay i thought so yes [Laughter] my wife still speaks next to me now i live in france sorry go on yeah so so basically as this uh came out one week ago i um i'm using this for a few days just to check if my muscle memory is is doing what it needs to do and typing fast but normally i am more on a classic design and this is another one which just came out uh one and a half weeks ago i guess this is from akko and this is like a more like the average design of a keyboard that you would think of it's like a plastic design and this is a is iso board with with a big enter key and i think this is 67 constantine correct me if i'm wrong uh yep 60 is without arrow keys like doubling it this is basically a 10 kilo so yeah yeah people oh dude there are so many questions but or i start with my own alvaro actually had a good one and that's more practical let's put it on the screen again so how are you dealing with recording and then the mechanical sound of the keyboard like i personally just don't deal with it because i think it's fine right now i'm just typing i'm not sure if you can hear it no but uh like yours is quite silent then so and i i don't have like any kind of eq so it's just like if you do it properly if you do like proper um mods then you'll get something really silent and also you you can like choose your switches uh for example i did this one which is also like a 40 percent percent uh which is like use only on the right hand but this is like aimed to be like the most silent thing that you can ever get so yeah it's all comes down on what switch do you use for example top ray is really nice or something silent and this is also one of the i mean one of the reason of why i went toppr but of course if you use like uh some clicky blues yeah um it won't be yeah it's gonna sound yeah but it's just this is also like the point of clicky it's like to be where oh yeah because i'm wondering like janus you put another one there let's see is based on this like if you're in a meeting and and let's say you're doing something with the customer because you're a developer and you're being asked in some sort of meeting and then you're frantically chatting to your colleagues about what they're saying in the slackjet and the customer will hear you typing rather than listening to them right so maybe just don't use a custom keyboard then i think that the more custom it gets the the more silent it will be oh really i mean not not when you're into gaming and or into clicky switches but most of the people that i know that are into the keyboard game are more into like silent make the board more silent so it will not be the the click that you would um imagine of the of the the mo of the older ibm keyboards so what they sound like so even if i put the microphone right on top of it [Music] should not be it's not crazy loud it's more like it's really it's just it's kind of nice i guess it sounds different than mine wait let's try this one wait i need to switch my camera let's see if that works right so this how does this sound well let's see i'm destroying my mic doing this i'm not sure if this is not as nice as yours man you're smoother we learn as we go but i also oh wait yeah constantine show yours so this is nothing yeah i i think you you are muted no no it's just really good uh just like that those are silence lubed especially for silence purposes so yeah you can't really hear them wow maybe if everybody really really hard but uh yeah so basically anybody who's saying oh yeah but no i prefer macbook chiclet because it's silent no no no it's not silent uh i mean more silence than something that is aimed to be silent with proper switches dampeners modes um yeah you know when i type on my macbook even this newer m1 one yeah when i type on it you can actually hear it resonate in the base and that goes through the microphone still to the meeting it's probably worse yeah this is also why uh for example my mic uh have some kind of um i'm not sure yeah i can probably show it that way but uh you can also have some mount to downpour and then also gets uh basically a mat for your desk uh that helps also and of course uh you'll get all the keyboard uh things so for example if you have let's say if you have some aluminium it may be a bit more noisy so you may use polycarbonate you can also choose the blade that you put which is for example you have some keyboards which are totally plateless meaning that you don't have any kind of resistance it's just like um like really smooth feeling but at the same time the feeling is not the same but at the same time as janus said it's more like a balance between oh this perfectly silent and you cannot hear it and also the fact that you like the feeling of it because usually when it's silent it's a bit more dampened and the feeling is a bit more mushy yeah this is what i don't like exactly so at least the person that's in the same room with you is really happy about it so that's nice [Laughter] yeah exactly and my partner also using like her own keyboard uh for example she's really in love uh with um um animal crossing i see a h oh a lot of my wife's the same she's like only animal crossing i love that yeah i can probably show it wait a few seconds okay so while he grabs that stuff so i have a noob question yeah so are mechanical keyboard keycaps all universal so yeah oh exactly here uh you have uh some kick outs which i will ask you in the second animal crossing uh you also have the artisan which is like a small key like tim did for example with his face yeah and so this is using grandma's case so which is also really lightweight and colorful and yeah it's not that hard to be on because she did it herself so i just gave some advice but this is like a 200 or maybe 250 one of the most expensive parts were the switches so as always you can just get some cheaper ones if you like um but yeah you as you can see you can totally customize it to your liking and she also have like the animal crossing desk mat and oh no she goes crazy i love it yeah so this is also why you get into mechanical keyboards it's because you can really customize your liking for example mine is really teal based because i love teal but yeah it really comes down to like your preference and you have all the choice that is available the only drawback is that you need to be like on ansi payout so like qwerty ish yeah that's the easiest i can imagine yeah um uh because otherwise uh you get like only five percent of the remaining choices because usually when people do make the keycaps themselves uh it's pretty tricky to get like the world broad spectrum of oh yeah so i i want french and at the same time german keyboard and nordic keyboard uh because the most popular is tier on quality with ansi so yeah yeah so while you were you were walking away from your chair i asked diana's about like about all these key caps right so the caps itself not the switches are they all like universal does that all fit you know tell us more well basically yes but no so i will i will show you i'll show you something when when we talk about keycaps um there are two big parts that separates uh them from another um from each other so there's first there's the layout the the profile so normally you are used to oem profile or maybe cherry profile cherry is another word that that happens quite often when you talk about mechanical keyboards and so this is also like the cherry stem like a cross stem and basically if you have this cross stem inside of your keycap it it should fit to to most of the of the key switches that you normally have like when you see these ones these are phantom rats from from ghetto run these are the holy panda x the other side so they all have this this stem on on top of it where you can put the the key cap on on top of it and so most of them have this right so i can generally get any sort of type of keycap and put them on these kind of stuff yeah yeah well you have to um think or or be aware of normally we we have three pin key key switches or five pin switches so uh the top if you have the the cross stem and you have the the normal key caps that that fits if you have something like the first mechanical keyboard which i started with blame me sharkoon and this is kale switches oh wow that's different and this is a really different type of keycap where you shouldn't i i never saw any other keycaps than the original ones to put on it so this is really really bad to to to buy something like this and think of modding it it's it's actually just realized i i took a keycap of that that um what do you call this logitech keyboard look what's behind yeah it's a membrane right yeah yeah oh no so i even if i wanted to i couldn't do anything with this [\___\_] but it's all good okay so um also i just want to say that uh for example if you get a logitech or coarser uh board usually you also have like some proprietary control and command or alt uh sizes meaning that for example the usual one is like 12 25 and then 125 125 but yeah uh corsair likes to make it like 175 or 150 and so you cannot swap them easily so that's why also going uh custom is pretty nice all right so now that we spoke about all these like so let's say let's for easiness sake say they're quite universal because we all just go with this style it's cool just don't go with the crazy ones sometimes it's cool but um so now you have keycaps have different styles right because when i bought my keyboard it had oh i forgot but i when i typed on it they were too close together and too high and i just had fat fingers all the time yeah and then i asked janos what do i do and he said buy these other ones and now there's like and then i looked at it okay there's like so many different ones so constantine what what for what are the different ones that we can use uh basically the most common one that you can you'll get uh is like cherry one uh so those first that's what i have now those are not cherry uh but those are still like kind of low profile switches uh keycaps uh i really don't like low profile uh so that's why i prefer like something really um tall uh so i'm not sure if you can see that yeah yeah so these are a little bit more pyramid-like right yeah yeah because cherry are pretty much like a small upside curve um but you get like really steep ones and you get bumpy ones um but yeah there are basically two things for the the keycaps uh you have the texture itself so it can be abs like the one that janice just showed before yeah his first one it's pretty much like abs because you can hear it you can see it it's cheap it's thin it's really low right yeah it's it's also that the noise is not that great because if it's thin uh it will be really high pitched um well if you get something really uh heavy and thick it will be like really nice and dumb dumb sound for example i really like pbt so pbt is like more a textured one more like that you'll get i don't know like in purses or like really hard plastic um and yeah and the other one as you said is like profile so you're you'll get low profile or you can even get like flat profiles so for example on the macbook you you have exactly so it's like no profile at all uh well usually uh when you have your um traditional keyboard you'll get something like uh which is like going up uh so going up like that um yeah yeah yeah sure like i i think yellow is very difficult uh so this is probably like a pbt um or cherry by the looks of it um by the light on it it feels like quite similar to what i have i think it's it might even be similar i mean the the the the profile of these the caps is oem this is not cherry this is yeah and so what is the difference between the oem and the cherries so cherry are basically a little bit lower and uh the difference like when we talk about low profile these are the ones from the sharkoon this is the same letter this is q so here's you from from the same row with uh this is dsa dsa is on every row there's the same flat design so you have no profile which is going like a curved style like the the little bit higher so dsa and also xda is the same height on every single row of the keyboard so you don't see anything that is going up or downwards here so then we have the non-sculpted profile basically all flat and here you can you can see how it's more sculpted when i go into the oem uh way this is like this uh queue and then we have uh acer or asa and you see how it's a little bit more sculpted and also even a little bit higher than the other one so asa is more on the high profile um and there are so many people that like high profile keycaps for me it's nothing too good i like cherry profile um i thought i i liked um flat profiles like dsa or xda but when you start typing and and and like feel what's the difference in in your typing speed and how your fingers and your muscles react to the profile um i would say there are not as many people that like the the flat profile than like cherry or oem okay yeah for me i was i had i think the ones you have now on the keyboard that i bought from kikrom and i kept making mistakes all the time and then you told me to go with these cherry ones that are slightly different and now it's about 50 times better or 50 yeah i'm wondering if i go even lower if it's better for me but probably not it's more like my fingers just never reach the key at the same place and if they're too close together i just miss and then i have fat fingers and so i might need like a smaller side on the top to like maybe more like this that might be better for me i don't know this is like total uh uh what is it dsa it's dsa crazy and funny the same also a really really low keyboard it's a new vs uh 75 and uh this is a really flat profile like this there's nothing to it when you look from the side and that's too much like that yeah yeah um but they have a really small footprint on the on the top of it that makes it more space between the caps which makes it more easier to to know where you are if you're blind typing like i i am normally so normally i don't care about the legends that's why i also like the the the blank one that constantine showed us uh but normally i am i am the german guy so i i need my e m and my so basically i am going with an ncde or isode but no also i don't i don't care when you look at this one it's the u.s layout yeah exactly yeah as i don't look onto the keyboard while i'm typing i i don't care what's what's on on top of it wow there's so much to contact that you may consider is really learn how to touch type so basically yeah just put the finger on the small knobs because on your finger on your keyboard you have your two keys so g and k which have some little nibs and so the main idea is to put your index on it and then move as uh as close as possible and to do like uh less movement uh by just thinking all right so my finger uh my right pinky for example we are reach for the enter key or for yeah i don't know for p um and also trying now this is going to be terrible yeah it's pretty hard at the beginning but uh if you get used to it you stop looking at your keyboard and you will get uh less fatigue overall and you'll die faster yeah is to always stay on the home row so this is like your the middle row right like this yeah and then uh this is where like the profiles the profile coming comes in because depending on what do you prefer uh sometimes something sculpted which is really high will be quite helpful uh but some people also prefer flat it also depends of the angle angle of your keyboard if you like it really tilted or not i like 8 to 12 degrees which is pretty high most people are fine with something like that which is yeah i have pretty high also i think it's hard to see yeah this is probably uh six or eight degrees yeah yeah so it's lower than yeah but uh yeah it's really like personal preference yeah it's um so what is that keyboard then that looks fancy as well this one is the apple maker b21 and this has the asa profile so you can see like the bottom row is so much lower than the other ones then it goes high and even higher on the on the top circles like like a wave up up there yeah and so guys um lucy just asked a question or not really a question but like she's like i cannot live without full size so why maybe this because we're just developers i like i use numbers a lot i went for 96 myself so i have the pad so guys tell me not a good reason this is not a good answer sorry okay tell me more because for example on my keyboard as you can see i have like my three rows of letters and then the one on the upper side is just like numbers so you're you're an asset you're lost with this right you need to be qwerty otherwise it's going to be a mess uh no uh this is not related to uh because you're gonna have to do a shift and then a number to get the number uh so usually for example if i need to press like f10 i just use my pinky here for my function key and then i go f10 and so as as you can see i don't move a lot no no let's do that it's better than moving your wall hand and reach like an f10 key so i can do pretty much everything that you can on a full-size keyboard just by the fact that i have a layer and this is also like one thing that you can get with custom keyboards is that you can put some layers so either you can hold the key or you can even toggle the key or you can even play like a piano uh this is uh coming from the fact that since it's your own custom keyboard um you can also customize the firmware and the software you need so oh yeah there's a whole new world it's not even like you need to install uh some stuff on your os it's just that you can put it into the memory of the pcb itself and then it will work accordingly to your settings so for example lucy says oh yeah so this like for example when you have yeah i was going to say does this kind of comment paint our hearts as keyboard enthusiasts because you do s excel so she meets it works it also does does something to you which is quite awesome because they are also if we talk about um layout and what what some people are missing it's normally the afro and the numpad because when i take the the afro and the numpad away i have something like like this i like to have my separate arrow keys still but i don't need an afro i don't need anything else and um some some people say that they need the full layout so they need the the full keyboard which would be something like this let me show you i think also i don't think the camera is even big enough for this we should so this is this is the kikron q6 and this is a full-size keyboard and what my biggest issue with full size is even if i would need the numpad all the time the angle where i could reach my mouse if i'm working a lot with my mouse my arm gets more and more angled so that's really in inappropriate to use your mouse like like that so that's why i i say i don't need the numpad you see there's someone who likes this that's also why you have some keyboards where you have the numpad on the left side i have seen that as well yeah but also so if you're really into the administrative work the the the keyboard game got you covered because they're also mechanical numpads that you can have so they have their own usb type-c they are full customizable they have hot swap switches and all the crazy stuff and what i do if i have to work with the numpad a lot and i have to type numbers a lot i just put keyboard mouse and then numpad next to it and that gives me the position to have my mouse on the right angle and still use my numpad when i need to because no one that uses the numpad on a daily basis can tell me that they use it like every single minute of the day it's like getting rid of the stuff you don't need and also you can also totally like press a key and change your keyboard into like a full numpad but still staying on your home row as i said like with qmk you can mode it uh as you'd like and that way you don't even need to hold the key for example so that there is like qmk uh which is like this kind of software uh you made the perfect bridge tell us what qmk is this is like an open source um project uh that basically you can flash uh your pcb and put like a lot of features uh one of uh the main one is like layouts layers so this is as i told you like either you hold the key or you can toggle it but you also have a lot of auto completion for example or any kind of hold this key and this will do something else you can even play music you can like really have a lot of stuff for example this keyboard that i showed before you have a knob for example so you can also like customize other as you like there are also people who put some kind of um some kind of i don't know the for for example you know like on uh thinkpads you have this red dot which is like oh yeah yeah and so you can also like map the joystick to a specific behavior or move your mouse with it even if yeah most of the time people just like use keyboard to move around and but yeah this is like pretty limitless and so even if you say all right so i need my number yeah but you can have your number on your keyboard which is like double and that's all wow yeah it almost feels like i'm not sure if it's like youtube's safe to say nipple but yeah yeah let's let's call it nipple oh yeah and actually lucy says this it actually is called the nipple i think it's true i used to own a thinkpad back in the day and these were indestructible they were pretty great i still have two of them yeah they are they are in indestructible i have one later on that then it became lenovo i think it's called yeah okay yeah it's not lenovo thinkpad basically and they are they still have the best keyboards on their laptop as of today yeah really good even if you type on the m1 which is ok uh it's still better than the keyboard from 2016 oh yeah that's like i had a macbook from 2019 um a relatively thin one and after four months the a button just stopped and the cat lock was always stuck like these ridiculous things i had to change the keyboard on my uh 2000 and what was it yeah also the the newer keyboard that was the new but the old chiclet strike keyboard on the macbook i had to change the the keyboard two times and it was always the always the f key i don't know why but it was oh really yeah so he's searching a lot in his codebase or pressing a lot of respect you know like yeah lots of apps so guys what do you think of this wait let me zoom in is this something that's cool to buy it's a little expensive i think but i'm not sure it's not so expensive for a fully assembled one with the knob hold on and it has the knob because i'm i don't actually need the f row like the last time i use the avro is to put up my volume on the macbook my mac right so and now it doesn't even say that it says f12 i don't care and so maybe something like this which is mainly like brown yes right now i think it's gateron brown okay so now that we're on here if it's not your first keyboard i would go to the bare bone and yeah and then do your own thing add your switches and your keycaps yeah you know what i might actually do it because i now have one that's proper i enjoy it but it's not it's i now know what i don't like but i don't know what i do like you know what i mean so i'm gonna have to learn this so i would maybe get but this size i like yeah and i love the fact that the arrow keys are slightly separated because if you look at um wait this keyboard that i have now let me just make this big so you can see it like this is the wrong choice you see that the arrow keys are completely connected to all the others that's the k4 right this is the k4 so it's a 96 keyboard i never tried that before and i just bought it because i thought i could buy it and like okay and i always miss so because i'm not used because before i had a full full one or i had a laptop one and so i'm always like one button to the right too much so i feel like if this is actually separated a little bit you have some context switch to that is better so i mean if it's separated just separated it's always uh better to to feel where where you are where the normal letters end and where the arrow keys start um i also have a q2 uh i landed it to a friend of mine for a few uh for a few days because he was i'm not gonna get it back i will i will give it i will get it back but he was very amazed by the keycaps which was the most set from a kikron okay and and also from the um that have ako matcha greens lubed inside of it which is a linear style really really damp and really smooth linear switch and he really liked it and he was like okay can i have this for a few days and yeah okay guys how about we just fill my shopping cart here so should i go with iso knob or normal i don't what is the difference here iso you have the big enter key the big enter key and two more keys so does it what what so if i go to iso it doesn't actually have an assembled one with iso i think yeah but is iso is basically like like this right you have the biggest so is it like a french knob like some baggage cheese no the the oh no oh okay yeah you see here the enter is big here so and again okay and then here it's small can you get it without the knob also yes yeah you can just go bare bone like this without the noise okay so what does that look without the knob it's just an insert button it's it's a key it's a normal key yeah like when they sold the uh let me guess i think i like the knob because if you look at the the q1 which i have here the the q1 they uh yes so this is the the version without a knob but this was a version where they put my name on on a special place no look at this guy yeah i love it so instead of the knob you have your name yeah yeah and i can switch the plates i can also take the plate off and put a switch in it i think i have to do some some soldering for that but i can do a switch on it and they're also like really um technically more capable human beings that can also insert a knob into it but yeah oh yeah but it's probably some sort of oh i don't know anyways okay i'm gonna put this on the screen um i mean what i would recommend is basically also trying to figure out what kind of style do we want at the end like maybe find some specific keycaps and so we we can also touch on that aspect because usually keycaps you can either buy some cheap ones uh from any kind of chinese website or you can also like join a group by and then get something really custom to your liking so yeah maybe give a try also to like some keycaps that you really uh like so the profile the the texture of it and also the colors or the theme maybe for now let's stay in here and see if we can actually filter on certain things yes search for the moza set if there's a search yeah like this yeah no mars like m-o-r-s-e sorry here we go yeah because that's the one that i have on my on my q2 and it's half transparent yeah and it looks really really really nice on top of it really really nice and it's actually the mozza code that that's printed on top of it oh so it actually has the morse code on it yeah look at this fanciness guys you can send in this voice and they are half transparent so if you scroll down i guess you can see it from from the side otherwise i have to share a picture from my board oh wait you can probably see it a little now you can scroll scroll scroll down i guess if they they show it somewhere somewhere down there yeah here you can see they are half trans transparent so even the you background light in your in your keyboard you can see that come through nicely yeah yeah look at this that's pretty cool it looks really nice yeah and also the haptics are really really good it's really smooth on top i just don't like the color scheme for me that's okay yeah that's just this is a personal thing so exactly yeah and so what is the look i have a k4 i can actually just get this now and put it on that's cool so what kind of um keycap type is this this so if this is like the cherry one or this is uh oh oem you see it on the top so the one the the one higher than i have now yeah mm-hmm so maybe you can google for uh like um uh keycaps profile on google and check all the uh photos of it that may yeah you mean this one right yeah for example yeah so the the first thing will be like to find out what do you prefer something flat something low something high so what i've learned is that the oem one i had fat fingers with it for sure that was not for me and now i have some scariest fingers uh then i'm just bad at typing that's just that one thing that's fingers uh this will not really be solved with a keycap i mean there are some keycaps which are hemispherical and other that are cylindrical meaning that rather than your finger uh just being inside of it it will kind of be embraced by the key so maybe this can help so those for example are mt3 profile but those are a bit harder to find harder to find yeah i guess because the ones that i've seen on these q i think maybe i don't know which one it was i think it was on this one like these keys seem to be easier for me to use i think this is the the development of kikron this is called the osa profile ah so it's special for them yeah yeah but it's still universal i think looking at the mapping seems to they legit um yeah i mean uh it's not logitech or corsair or whatever no no exactly but it's i mean the worst keyboard that you can get is probably from razer uh if you don't pick gaming uh when it will be okay um anyway so yeah don't sweat it too hard on the on the brand just go like no exactly websites and it should be okay yeah so maybe i can give a word on on the keycaps because there is like something really uh exotic in the hobby uh meaning that for example i just received a pack of keycaps um just like a few days ago okay but i've ordered it in 2020 so it's basically like 24 months and so this is just to explain how the hobby works uh so for example uh depending of um the type of profile that you like um and the the colors uh um basically um yeah let me maybe find it uh but yeah um if you have really specific profile which is maybe new or which is kind of exotic or with some colors uh then you can get like pretty pretty sad uh i'll send that in the chat for people who want to to know which one i'm talking about but basically what is a group buy um this will be um something where you can say oh all right so i am interested by this um actual um uh key set meaning that uh if any if enough people are interested so you get an interest check and then you get a group by and then you have a few weeks to join and say all right so i want this one and then you pay and maybe one year or two after you will receive your keycaps so this is a bit scary but uh people in the make a keyboard community are really serious about this and so they may have some delays regarding oh so we have some mold issues or we have some technical issues or maybe we change some colors because those were not good enough and so they are really trying to nitpick uh the quality over like quantity or just speed daily delivery so yeah it was the same for my partner because for example you cannot go like to your home depot or uh whatever place and just uh get like one uh really custom like uh animal crossing so usually for that you just need to look what is available and then join a group by but if you miss it you can always go to secondhand market so there is like this mechanical keyboard reddit where there is a lot of people who are selling secondhand keyboards keycaps pcbs and a lot of stuff so basically what i'm trying to say is take your time to find the one that you like if it's available straight away perfect just go for it but if you want a profile maybe a bit more exotic or a bit more fancy yeah just take the time to go to websites like gig hack or a lot of discords also have those kind of things where you can just see what is available as of specific given time and then join and then you'll get your really fancy kitkats at the end yeah exactly really fancy oh here so let's put this one on first it's mechanical keyboard then it's individual artisan keycaps i so could not agree more like um here wait let me show this one so i bought this keyboard and then i didn't fully like it and then janos helped me and then i went to this oh oh where is it here so i went to this guy and then i wanted my own like he can actually buy this is pretty cool what he has so you can get this kind of stuff and he just prints it at home himself i don't know how he does it but then i spent so much money on this and i and i don't even have a fancy keyboard i just have one that i changed a little bit [Music] it's kind of interesting to see how deep you can go because we didn't even talk about like for example what i wanted to know as well is so if i had to change one thing on a keyboard like my first like customization which one actually makes the biggest difference sorry about what yeah sure yeah if you want to do a keyboard mode yeah maybe janos you can go there like if i wanted to do one which one makes the biggest difference for maybe sound or feeling yeah a hundred percent lube your keyboard this will make the biggest difference ever oh really yeah in terms of feeling and also in terms of sound and then probably put a mat yeah so the phone thing on the inside is probably the easiest to do i guess yeah or you can put a sticker which is like the the two dollar hack uh yeah i i mean there are some uh there is like this mod tab which is basically putting a piece of tap between your pcb and your key and your switch yeah so this is pretty nice i also have a blog post on how to make it properly oh i will read that for sure this is really like um not that difficult but it all comes down as you can see here for example here we have a piece of foam i'm not sure of the exact type of it but this will help reduce the sound you also have brands like rama works who are doing like really specific and made for specific case so yeah it's really like diverse so [Music] yeah so constantly i noticed as well like we just got a quick comment your mic is it that lower than us yeah so now it's a bit higher there we go i guess it's still a bit lower but it's okay yeah i i don't want to to be too noisy but yeah uh if it's okay tell me yeah it's fine i guess okay well we'll we'll ask the chat in a sec so janos did you make this foam yourself it looks like tape to me this is not a foam this is this is just tape so this is just basic tape that i put onto it so uh as you can see here these are just like two layers of tape right on top of the pcb so this is where the pcb looks from from downside where you can see where all the other switches go into oh and you made the lights as well and you basically put the tape on on top of it to dampen the sound a little bit and this is just painters tape right sorry this is just painting tape this is just painting tape yeah some some swear on on a blue tape but i don't care about the color of the jacket oh my god we can go so deep in the type of tape you yeah yeah so you can also get like really absorbent matte uh i mean you also have like a lot of um polyurethane or whatever materials it's like for like um for the sound if you want to get silent room you get like a million of uh materials so it's pretty much the same for the keyboards wow and so i can imagine uh janos when i look at this that this company already put some of that dampening in because that's that's what people want so why is it not there why do you but there are two two things this is a gasket bounce so what you can see here is are the gaskets that like a small foamy sticky stuff that uh that separates the the plate and the pcb from from the rest of of the case and it also added adds some flex to your to your typing so uh when when you when you push on onto the key it does some flex because the the foam is uh doing its thing right is that what you want generally or not there are people that they like as much flex as they can get and there are people that more like it's like mechanical keyboard and all the all the stuff that we talk about is pretty much what you yourself want or need or feel that you want it's never it's always a personal thing if someone asks what's the best keyboard and you ask 100 people you should for sure get 100 different answers oh my god yeah and this is also one thing i'm considering now okay let me just try something but i guess i've never felt it before and so then you buy like expensive stuff and then you might not like it and you just have to buy something else or are there like now that corona is a little bit better you just go to some keyboard con and just to feel all the keyboards yeah speaking of that there is one uh on the third of september um in france in paris so if some people are interested you can uh join this i'll send it in the chat oh please do it and so they're gonna come to paris and then yeah there you can go and like try basically like i don't know two or three hundred various keyboards and switches and i mean there will be like 500 uh people like janos and me there just like sharing their crazy builds and this is like the perfect place because as you'd say if you buy something and you're not really happy with it yeah you're kind of screwed uh otherwise there is also like the second way uh you can open a twitch channel and just ask people to send you their own parts and then you build them and then you can try them and send it back for them so you'll get sometimes i mean there are people doing that for free when you start uh but then you can also put a small commission on it but yeah it all depends on the bill and the price um and i mean for example if you get like um the the chance of uh being able to be on the keyboard for i don't know like two or three thousand euros yeah it's always okay you know to not get the commission on it because you have uh the chance of building itself and also trying various stuff um maybe you'll fall in love with it and you want the same or maybe you'll say oh this is the this is like super bad i don't want that so yeah it also helps quite a lot this is how i went into this hobby i was like all right so this seems amazing uh by watching on youtube but yeah you can't feel the video so no that's the thing right just go to meet up now that cavities is over when when when when i started uh the mechanical keyboard game from my side i uh found out that the iso de caps are very rare but there are so many germans looking for it and they're like okay you have black and white and white and black and maybe some colors from from cross air keycaps yeah and that's pretty much it so i started the keyboard community and we are now over 417 people i guess in the telegram group and we are only talking about keyboards and keycaps and all the stuff and we also have a vendor in the chat i guess keo keyboards is one of uh is a small company from from germany and they are doing um ansi de keyboards they pre they pre-modded so what you get is a pre-modded fully functional perfectly sound dampened keyboard and they also sent two of them to me for testing purposes and i send it back so um i i'm not fully sponsored i love that that um that manufacturers sent me keyboards for testing so i'm i am in a very good position to have all the different uh switch styles and keycap styles and keyboards and layout and sizes everything here and within the community i also lend out keyboards like the q2 or like the k8 pro to other people from the community and they send it around so some of my keyboards are all around germany just for testing purposes and that's what you what you really need because sometimes you need to feel the keyboard that's what content constantine said just just now you need to feel it to know what you want especially because some people may think all right so i want to buy the those switches for example um but i'm not sure of which one to take and so you can get those boards of 50 switches in a row which are all different and you can dive on being like oh this is great oh oh no this is bad but um this is not relevant at all because uh if you don't have a world keyboard of those switches you will not get the wall uh spectrum of the field no exactly you need more than a few yeah right this is like a fake solution basically yeah that's also why why switch testers are so important to see what kind of switch you are up to because there are box switches as you see here so the the cross is boxed which also makes a little bit different sound and there are like clear caps which is good if you have an rgb or if you're an rgb type of guy you should look for for switches that let the the light through because red switches like like these ones are always in a red tone no matter what rgb you put into that and here's another one which is really dark so it it darkens it out a little bit with you if you use rgb and then it's like the the the switch game every single switch is different and i would say from my experience what i bought switch-wise the aqua kings v3 which is this this one it comes pre-looped you don't have to do anything to it it sounds really good and it's a really linear feel it's not too strong it's not too weak so it's a really nice in between anything and it's just it sounds really really good so good question shouldn't all of these switches come lubed isn't that like or do some people not like that yeah it depends first off because not all companies are doing that well uh some for example may use some machines which are automating the process uh but these have the risk of oh there is too much or not enough and then you'll get a whole batch of like oh yeah consistent club so it doesn't really help at all and also this is also a personal preference as always because you have various loops you can get like some oil or you can get some grease or you can have a mix and even if you choose a grease you have i don't know like 15 types of crease and it also depends of the switch because if it's linear or if it's tactile um yeah as you can see there but there you go it also depends on the state of your switch how you used it uh the exact type of it so yeah some brands tried it but usually it's not that good yeah so people tend to want to do it themselves now i mean if you are doing that yourself it's not that hard the only thing the only rule that you need to follow and to understand is the less the better that's all you really don't need to overload otherwise it will be super annoying to remove it will uh be counterproductive and it will just ruin the world feeling experienced yeah but i mean it's a lot of work still there are services where you can uh send your your switches to and they lube it for you like uh like the way you want it and it normally works but it's also an expensive service because on on every single switch you need like or you you should work with a switch opener just like like this one and you put the switch on top of it and then you just push it down let me check this way don't break your switch no no no no so you just break it push it down and then it opens up so you have the the top case of the switch and you need to put it somewhere then you have the the stem itself ah show that yeah there so this is an mx style kind of stem then you have the the spring as this is a tactile switch you see another another part of it here which is this metal plate which is the tactile thing the the the bump in between from top to bottom there's a little bump and then there's the bottom case yeah and you normally loop with a with a small uh what is it called like cosmetic yeah thing and you just loop it just a little bit and that's it on on on the side parts on it just where where the actual movement is but you don't want to have the the the metal plate here somewhere green it also depends of your preference sure yeah for example i like really to look everywhere i mean uh in the good spots but not too much and so it takes me a bit more time but you can also be a bit more messy for example because people tend to also loop the springs but there are some hacks because you can put the springs into a bag of two bags and just shake it yeah yeah there are really a lot of um various approaches but for example my partner did that and for her first time she spent five hours on 68 switches uh basically you can do that every year also when you feel like you need it so it's not like something that you need to do like every week so yeah it depends of the amount of keyboards that you have and that you want to do also wow there's so much to unpack i love it actually it's it's it's good learning and i have to be careful that i don't fall into the trap and never come out again yeah uh it's too late you're gonna i'm already in to be honest um yeah yeah this i'm gonna have to i'm gonna probably like buy another keyboard after this stream but then buy everything separated and then build it myself on the next yeah exactly if there is one thing to to get out of this live is yeah just be on your own custom keyboard because it's not difficult you have a lot of tutorials especially now because uh two or three years ago uh they there wasn't like as much content on mac keyboards now it's like super blooming everybody is talking about it yeah so you have a lot of nice content on youtube and people doing that daily pretty much so you can just like see what they're doing and yeah you really cannot mess it too much i mean usually what you do is you buy uh maybe two or three more switches just to be sure for example if you basically spin but that's pretty much true um you cannot fry it you cannot burn it i mean there are some uh keyboards that you need to solder but this is not mandatory you can also have hot swap keyboards so yeah just do it yourself it will be cheaper more custom and a lot of fun yeah exactly oh here look we have some nice comment here so we decided to send switch experience packages four different styles with all new keyboards from now on so people could try different like this is really cool because then you can actually try and see what you like and then buy the real thing but so ku how much do you actually um how many switches do you send is it like one of each no four four different so yeah one each so i guess it's like 240 like for 60 uh basic layout now they they if you order a keyboard they send like um four extra switches like like let's say linear one a tekta one a blue one and uh oh yeah and then you can just put it on and then feel it yeah and then you can say oh okay i i'm maybe more like the the tactile switch and then get some texture switches well that's very interesting it's a nice surface to do what i what i am very interested what is your opinion constantine of these little guys uh um so yeah uh for those who don't know those are o-rings so those are small hacks that you can put in between the pcb and the switch so the fact of it is basically you you will press the key and it will squish it i don't like it [Laughter] mainly because i feel like one of the things that you um that you come to the hobby is to get like the actual uh better typing experience so get less rsi uh yeah like lucy says orthodontist elastic thing for the for the teeth uh but you know um i do like uh make keyboards because of the long travel i don't like laptops because it's like really hurting your hands because you're just pressing the keys and it's like two or three millimeters of travel yeah so doing that it's like yeah you're gonna press the key but you will stop early because you just cannot go further but you're not used to it so yeah i don't like it also because the sound of it may be okay but the experience um yeah it just gets too much of a hit uh yeah yeah there's there's a lot of hate going on when you when you when you talk about o-rings in the custom keyboard section oh really yeah yeah yeah and there are some i only have them because some keyboards send it with them and i just put it somewhere and i i get them where i i send them away for free if someone really wants to have them because i'm like no i i don't either i don't like them it makes the keyboard so mushy yep you just you just you're going into a mechanical keyboard uh topic and you get your perfect keyboard and then you like it's like putting no running your porsche with two double-a batteries yeah yeah yeah that's also why you don't see o-rings on 3000 keyboards uh builds um i can imagine that they make it feel a little bit more like i don't know the word but it's not going to be like tactile or something it's like smooshed i can imagine it's not great yeah you you also have various uh depth of it i mean those can be like quite uh tall or wide but yeah it's not like a nice experience um yeah i don't recommend it i mean it's great if you have um janos is probably phrased oh yeah your battery maybe died oh yeah yeah my my double a batteries went went down you and my friend june in the chat and he's like a keyboard wizard as well so so what's your key i'm wondering actually i want him to come into the stream so he can show his keyboard i'm going to send him the link see if he feels like showing his face if not we continue but i send him the link and if he joins i'll put him on um so let's see if i still had some other questions that i still didn't know a lot of things we already went in depth oh there's one really newbie question i have what are butterfly switches bad switches don't just just don't a butterfly switch i think they are not butterfly switches yeah butterfly switches are just like for the macbooks uh so as yeah you cannot say uh showed it's like basically just a butterfly in that way because you have like the mechanism doing that when you press on it um yeah it's nothing like really um specific but yeah butterfly switch is is one where you don't get a lot of height and you need to have still like a decent uh have feedback so you just put like some kind of spraying mechanism but yeah you probably have a membrane on the one that you showed us yeah so i was just thinking so then this is a membrane one so looking at the yeah i mean already maybe typing it oh wait here here's the sound it feels mushy now this is scale switch but if you look at them the switch oh no those are alps okay all right uh i think they are actually logitech specific oh yeah so it's omron g or whatever yes this is like some kind of uh arm switches so yeah you have uh cherry you have alps you have buckling you have to play basically you have a huge family of switches alps are not that great usually you [Music] yeah you have like i don't know like 15 families uh cherry is by far the most popular it's like 90 percent of the market but also usually are pretty bad because they are scratchy and yeah you also need like a specific keycap to be mounted on it and yeah indeed you also have um some optical switches from logitech so this is like really you don't feel anything you just it's literally the light that goes on or off that says yes or no basically it just cuts the laser and that's all that's so magnetic switch yeah i never heard of switches like that i've heard of maglev case so basically the dampening itself is just done with magnets so this is probably the best feeling ever but it wasn't released i mean not like really in a good shape as far as i saw the last time but yeah switches i don't think it's physical because you'll need quite a strong magnet to have like some feedback uh yeah and i can imagine after a year the magnet stops working yeah and also like if you have some hardware stuff next to your keyboard yeah it's maybe not the best thing you put your credit card or your phone next to your keyboard yeah they're like also like semi-mechanical switches which i think it's razer that put it into their their newest boards they are semi-mechanical and they are like then there are the opticals and inside of the optical switches there are some differences because kikron made their own optical switches that you cannot interchange with with other vendors so it's um if you go into the not normal mechanical uh there are some let's call it exotic switches because you cannot just buy other ones and it's very limited to what you what you buy at first glance yeah like i'm looking at on twitter now and people are talking about the magnetic switches let me just show you that picture that's really funny yeah let me share my screen so we got any kind of other noob question there there are no new questions don't worry look what the guy did wait i need to zoom in there's something mechanical going on here i don't know what's happening can we make it bigger look there's something but it's nothing to do with the keyboard i think yeah it's like you make any uh magnetic length yeah just to keep the lift closed i think yeah it's like a safeguard for your children if you don't want them to be on laptop for too long i just googled it and they're talking about mac laugh keyboard maybe that's what you meant lucy but yeah magnet is for the case it's not like follow the switch yeah exactly so maybe i'm missing something if it's the case sorry uh oh um i am generally missing anything everything here because everything is new okay so june asks how often do you loop the switches i think we just discussed like you would do like once a year maybe it depends if it's oil grease and yeah of your personal boyfriend um if we can get something from this stream it's like custom keyboard and personal preference yeah but it depends you you can be late to the party you'll just feel that your key is a bit more scratchy or maybe less smooth to be to be used i have to say that i did include mine for a long time i need to to clean it and to love it i know that but yeah it's also like quite some work so when you get like a weekend it's a nice thing to do but um yeah yeah i use yeah so the question is also like uh do i use uh 205 geo i mean i i don't know how to say that 205g is hero yeah so basically this is crytox uh no i use triposis 3204 for my tactile ones because i'm really a tactile guy yeah for example this if i'm not mistaken it's an oil so it will go faster uh um yeah it's not the same feeling uh not the same uh effect uh because uh when you do it can um impact the sound the feeling the scratchiness the resistance it can yeah make or break your switch i'm more of a tribosis guy i normally use 205 g0 for everything i loop only if i loop the springs in a bag i have some some spray lubricant which is a little bit more fluid than the 205 g0 which is so much better because when you have all the springs inside of a bag you just want to have it everywhere and that's sticked onto a spring somewhere because it's not too too fluid um there's a comment from june and we weren't sure we were going to talk about it but i'm just going to put it on remember when we're preparing this are we going to say the word or not there we go [\___\_] yeah there there it is there it is there it is yes so so [\___\_] the sound of a a key cap on a switch hitting the keyboard which is in a enthusiastic keyboard and environment of human beings just to make the sentence as weird as possible um that's the sound the keyboard does like the [\___\_] like it's it's not a cluck it's not a click it's a [\___\_] it's just a dampened sound where you hit it and and it feels like a little bit foggy so the thuckiest i have is probably something in between this and that so this is the aco acr 75 pro and it sounds like this okay and then uh yeah it it has uh speed silver switches i guess from akko the cs version and here's the aqua kings v3 on the q1 in an uh aluminum body oh that has a bit more low end to it and this is a little bit more [\___\_] so it's it's not it doesn't have to be as silent it's not about having this the most silent board but having a sound that is that makes you feel comfortable if that makes any sense so if you ask 100 people about thought you should also get keep putting these many answers usually if you want to get like a nice [\___\_] uh you use some pbt and some really high profile and also the case um but um those are these newer switches that i have now these pbt ones the sound became way better you mean the keycaps yeah yeah yeah yeah for sure sorry yeah so if you have an unlooped switch on an unmodded or most mostly unmodded keyboard all right it's a tactile so let's hear that one oh boy that sounds more like my keyboard yeah and also like the spacebar and any kind of modifier is oh but that's the only thing i modded on this board is the spacebar because i thought oh i i've seen worse than this one but uh oh you put some stuff in it literally normally yeah i i put weight and sound dampening in my keyboards uh by using alubut alubutul which is normally a sound dampening it's a sound dampening [Music] aluminum kind of gum or rubber that you normally put into your car to dampen the sound so and they are sold in in maths and you can really use it for everything so i make my spacebar a little bit heavier with it and also less hollow okay so people who would like to put what about these switches on the spacebar are you this kind of guy no i use the same switches on the under on all of them on like one board one switch type nothing nothing more oh so you could even change the switches up between the different keys just to make it feel better yeah i have heavier ones on the top or maybe on the spacebar or the modifiers i don't have that on some of my keyboards it's pretty nice because you get more resistance and that way you also know like which key you are hitting and it also helps flat fingers uh because if the key is harder to press you can mess it less easier so yeah it's pretty easy like normally when you are in in into gaming you have like your w a asd with a different switch style or something like that then you can like you really you do not have to look onto your board to feel where you are all right so next noob question which keyboard is the best for games no answer i know but that's why i asked it i mean define the game first off because uh oh yeah and fps doesn't really matter that much okay okay but for nerdy s for example starcraft you probably don't want something like too linear and too fast i think but for example if you play i don't know um if you're a pleb and you don't have an arcade thing but you still play i don't know street fighter yeah you'll probably want something like blazing fast like uh yeah slow travel really fast but that would almost be like popping the whole thing right where it's just on or off yeah or maybe like optical laser which is but you also don't get any kind of feedback if your key is pressed so and so if i just play battlefield on my pc it doesn't actually matter at all i mean if you play it in front of your tv with an xbox controller yeah it doesn't matter no no sure yeah but for example i remember i played a game with this and it's that's because this feels good it's fast but then i had this one for a while and these switches are really hard to press it's really heavy yeah and this is slow as heck so when i tried to play with this i had to really get used to like having to really press my wasd stuff you also have some other limitations for example n key rollover which is like basically you cannot like press too much key uh which are aligned on the same pcb line uh oh interesting yeah the i mean the the custom keyboards are pretty much without it because they are well made but for example the gaming keyboards usually have some kind of limitations on that um but let's say that yeah the hardware doesn't really matter for gaming it's more like your game knowledge it's not because you have like 10 milliseconds or 50 milliseconds of ping that it will like oh man i just lost because of my connection you know it's like that's more back in the day that was more important than now like also if you have like like the fastest keyboard and you use it over bluetooth with uh five other bluetooth devices around only using bluetooth 4 bluetooth 3. uh your keyboard can be as fast as it is but if the connection is not stable i was i was once always on bluetooth keyboards and then 2.4 gigahertz keyboards like like um yeah but now i am all wired because i don't want to mess around with batteries or any connection issues so i have a wire on it and that's it yeah and it just works yeah yeah yeah that's very better wiring on my side really everything you're also doing a wire yeah uh i mean i'm just using wi-fi but otherwise all my devices mouse i mean i do have a wired uh xbox controller this is pretty annoying because uh it wears out pretty quickly i mean it's like three or four years already but yeah it's not like super sturdy but this is pretty much the only thing that i consider being wireless on my desktop um yeah june june says in in the chat i have the coolest black guitar thank you you probably do you might want to show it the elevation this one yeah yeah these rotations are great they play really really well ovation 12 12 string yeah a whole other other other topic but talking about wired guitars i have i can say many many things but let's not do that because [Laughter] yeah i don't have any guitars there yeah but if you like a whole other topic when we talk about wiring and keyboards that's also something different because then we're talking about coiled cables and everything so that's also a whole yeah well you have your custom coiled cables that are like if you say the q2 is expensive i have cables that are as expensive as the whole board that you just wanted to buy yeah my partner did that for animal crossing also because if you don't get the cable you are not a real fan you know but uh there are also people who are doing their own cable because it's cheaper and you can get something more custom or more sturdy but you also need to be pretty decent at soldering and knowing what you're doing because you can treat things pretty quickly but it's also pretty fun there are a lot of people doing that for um computer uh psus for example if you want to get some custom braided uh colorful cables which are not like too long so you just cut it long enough for a second like curving into your motherboard so yeah this is also like wall hobby and there is like a channel uh explaining how to do that uh linux tech tips also did that um so yeah i've done that my whole life with all my guitar cables they're all custom made because otherwise they just like i was on tour like i didn't go to school and i played music and then you always go to like these crappy bars and stuff and um people stand on your cables they break they wrote cars over them and so i just made my own and nowadays um do we still have connection or maybe it's on my end am i bad everything's okay okay on my end i see you guys frozen anyways so what we have in the guitar world is you can actually have these you can solder less cable management basically you can make cables and just pressing them together and these cables are basically the strongest ever i wonder if that can also work with keyboards because it's much easier when we talk about usbc and usb 3.0 have guests 3.0 five five wires that's why um many custom keyboard custom cable makers that are doing it by hand are still referring to usb 3. three point one equals two or even or even two yeah um so we have another question so what is an aviator split that's what i just showed so basically you have like a usbc type on on one end yeah oh yeah focus it focuses on your eye there we go yeah i didn't activate the product focus so this is the usbc and this is an aviator connector so you just put where's the cable of it so you have another part of the cable where you can say okay i need it that long because it has to go from my pc to somewhere this is a usb type a yeah two aviator this is male right male and female and so you just have you just can put it together and there are different styles of aviator connections but um so this part lies on your desk and if you want to switch this part you just have to unplug the aviator connector and get your other cable because you switch boards and the cutter schemes doesn't match your your desk which is awkward oh boy so i'm now going to have to buy a nice cable as well okay that's kind of fun though um yeah i also forget the name i always forget the name of this one because you you have the you have the aviator one which is like yeah the usual one now you can even find it on amazon but there is also oh yeah so i cannot really paste it on there uh but there is also like this thin one um i always forget the name i'll send the etsy link in the chat yeah i can just put it in the chat and we can if you want to open it and share it do you mean that one no no not this one like check the one that i've sent on youtube this is like this is called aviator here but this is not a theater or this like another name um i think i might have a little delay in whenever the chat is coming in so but you could send it in the private chat if you want yep because this is not aviator this is not lipo or meepo i forget the name of that one but this one is super sexy but it's even more expensive okay so all right let me just zoom that in a little for the audience to say i always uh forget the name but so yeah basically here the connector is not like a five pin it's like uh two small uh with the two red dots that you can see on the third image for example um yeah it's pretty it's pretty nice also because uh that way you don't hit any kind of thing because i like aviator but it's also like quite heavy and for example if you unplug it and you have your monitors or i don't know your stuff yeah it just uh yeah you can break stuff with it because it's pretty heavy and it's like wall metal so but this one is also super nice this is very cool dude yep i forgot the name so sorry look at this this is a whole keyboard price but you mean that constantine is this one right uh i guess because it's just plugging in together with this little uh it looks quite similar with this one it looks similar yeah yeah what's the name of this one i mean i never had one um cable it's called cable no there is a name for that one uh i i i i know but i don't know yeah i forgot um those kind of things are sometimes a bit hard to google um but yeah oh yeah and thanks lucy i didn't know that you couldn't post links on youtube no same over here we're learning something from lucy that's nice perfect you live streams a lot with prismic so yeah she she's more used to it i guess so i'm wondering like what lucy said like when are we gonna have keyboard plugs with xlrs oh that would be nice that would be nice it's already feasible you have three connections so i don't think you can do it it's a ground and a plus and a minus yeah but you can still hike it on the receiver or the other end for me it's feasible because don't really need all five of them i think yeah i think it should work yeah i saw that one on reddit uh one day so yeah it's probably feasible yeah and i i i will not be surprised like if it was feasible uh for example uh one day i've checked some people doing like some really look there it is yeah this one's pretty nice oh and also it's like teal it's like super beautiful but it's mini xlr it's not real xlr yeah but it's cuter you know so look this this is decent yeah especially in black uh where it's met yeah it's perfect i think i need to buy something like that you need two to be sponsored yeah okay so who who is who can we sponsor here who's this swiftcables.net all right is it a german company i have no idea let me see that and also we when we talk about group buys and keycaps it's almost always um gm gmk what does that mean and gmk is a company from germany and they they do the production of these custom keycaps that are mostly inside of the group eyes or part of the of the group eyes but the weirdest thing is that they are produced in germany then sent to the united states yeah where they where they are sent by drop or some some other companies again to germany and you pay all the taxes and all the customs onto it so like export it and then re-import it and it and it's even more expensive than just buying it here in germany yeah that's right living in europe but outside of germany is nice because you just get the proxy but you don't pay for the the taxes i don't know what this is but it looks pretty fancy i think that's just a big one that i had here yeah yeah so here you you have two things you have the inner one which is just like basically red and gray and then you have a layer on top of it so i forgot the name of those two but the the transparent one on top of it is uh especially the product protected so as i told you before you can create your own so you can get like just the cable or you can get something around it to be all sturdy so this is pretty cool yep okay for my birthday is growing the whole time yeah like on the on on this one i have like that's a white cable and there's uh a black net around it so it makes it a little bit grayish and looks awesome oh it does that's pretty cool but in the end it's just a fancy way to do anything with usb cables that's what it is it's still connected to a standard usbc on and it does nothing more than connecting the keyboard to your mac or pc the the customization man uh it's all about the customization the theming of your brand you know yes this is the biggest thing on my um personal website i chose at one point to do this branding stuff because why not and i work at agencies my whole career so we always had to do this branding stuff so now i think there's two things left a custom keyboard that's branded towards what i like and then a vs code theme to my to my colors and then i think i have reached maximum penetration of my my brand there are there are people who uh have uh taken inspiration from um sarah dressner's knight oh yeah and they have that one running yeah but this is also great like if you want to customize your own thing um yeah it's a good start the one that she made is really good it's pretty explanatory on what it does and how you can uh update it so yeah it's pretty nice we also need branded cables we need conference cables you know like you go to a conference as a speaker and then you get like uh i don't know if you just land on cable uh there is one in germany uh soon so we probably yeah october five right yeah exactly very interesting so i'm going to need a custom keyboard custom cable and a custom vs code theme that looks like my colors and then you need and then you need your custom can holder for your 0.5 meter the thing is though some custom keycaps don't forget that those are like the most important the color scheme and exactly so me are there things that exist like you know what is the name um a company like printful that does kind of like drop shipping related things like this hat was sent to me by content.ai that's a it's a headless cms and they just made this in printful made the hat custom and then send it out close to the user right so i live in france so it was sent from germany i think if you live in australia it sends from japan if they had this for keyboards where you can kind of just customize your own thing that would be so cool so much that's actually a company in germany where you can do this you can upload your own svg to the keycaps and you have your fully printed abs it's not ppt but a fully printed photorealistic abs keycap set that's exactly what you want i think i've seen one on etsy where you can actually put the picture of your dog over your whole keyboard so all the keycaps have like part of the dog that could be fun there's so many options here let's see do we have any more questions that i had because i'm becoming quite saturated with all the information i'm going to have just just said i hope you have the custom bank account for that already yeah yeah i'm going to get some sponsors from my buy me a coffee or my github sponsorships then i'll buy keyboards with that then you can do an only fans and sell pictures of your feet or something like that you know what i might say that but there's probably a market for it sure yeah dutch guys living in france with beards all defense kind of thing like maybe i can do an old event where i speak french but badly maybe that now we're getting off track no lucy is bringing it back only caps all right buy the domain name onlycaps.awesome um i don't think i have another question like i had a question here that's like what is tkl but i think we covered that kind of it's 10 kilos exactly smaller than full size and bigger than 60 so maybe as a last one what are all the different sizes oh [\___\_] that was just three questions you have 100 90 80 75 70 65 60 40 27 and even 15 percent but 96 you have 96 98 also there's something 96 so it's not a good choice but also everything [Music] i saw i saw one one uh guy sent a picture into my community with like four keyboards at at once like um from the amount of switches and he has a special block article where he describes every single purpose of the switch and why he uses it so he's coding he's he's cutting cutting videos and all this stuff and he uses every single switch for a single purpose so there's this one guy he's uh he used to be the the video editor for linus tech tips which was like it's a youtube channel that has like 10 yeah yeah i know who you are talking about that video oh yeah and he has a macro for everything and he has like six keyboards and then he has all these separate like um keypads with like the 10 keys on it and the numbers and stuff and he used it like when you see him edit like i think a few years ago there was like him versus another youtuber yeah thanks i always forget his name and oh darren yes exactly and so it was him versus i justine who is like a an apple type youtuber lady yeah he was about 16 times faster in the edit than her and they did the same kind of thing because he just yeah but she was using final cut pro so the yeah and like a mouse yeah now that uh i mean what he's doing uh is okay he's also using um some mods for windows where basically you can uh replicate what uh qmk is doing but more on a software level so yeah that means that basically you'll get a macros program or software uh so you can get faster what is this wait let me make that that's the board i was talking about this is one keyboard this is one keyboard yeah yeah it's like if you have three friends who want to play all together you just put you can you can either either type all the letters on these two parts or in or in the middle and has all the macros all around it so basically it's one keyboard two keywords for normal typing and then all the other stuff around it so it depends on the way or the pro of the software he uses if he does like the split typing oh that's another one oh you're moving oh be careful then no no no no so it depends you can you can like type on these two and have all the macros around it or he focuses on just typing here like texts and stuff and then he has a normal keyboard maybe he just applies replace flight simulator or something oh no you can just take your chair move it offset it a bit to the right and then you have the wall excel experts you know type of keyboard and then guys this is too fancy um so thank you so much we're reaching the two hour mark which is probably not even a long time to talk about keyboards i guess if you guys are between you you can talk for five hours about specific lubing and springs and stuff but i don't know enough so thank you for letting me ask my complicated questions or my simple questions i learned a lot i'm actually ready to now build my own and so i already have a date with june who was in the chat here to do a keyboard build together um what is it yeah we i need to talk to him to see what is the best way because i need to actually buy the stuff get the right things and then it shouldn't be a 16 hour stream because i have to loop every single little thing right so we need to kind of maybe loop them ahead of time exactly more interesting this is what usually streamers do they have and if you want to check out uh videos about custom keyboards i there are a few really really nice ones are really really good channels that you can check out like teja types he's probably one of the most known custom keyboard builders then there's wildcat um wildcat uh i don't even is he is he or she i don't even know because you only see hands i think it doesn't actually matter right it's fine i it's it's a human being yeah but um like teja types wildcat then there's al alexottos i like sotos you find him on twitch and he's he's doing many build streams where he just builds keyboards for his customers so those three i guess are really nice to see and just check out different switch types also when you start watching those three then you'll notice that basically you have uh 50 more and 200 more and yeah it will be like exponential um yeah but janus we should also uh put in your yours in the chat maybe i can put it in chat because i'm owning the channel what is your do you have like a short link to your youtube channel it's slash janus minerskill yeah oh that's easy enough let me just put that in let me see [Music] i'm bad at typing maybe i'm i'm basically just lost whatever keyword i make or get yeah but mine is not a no not an underscore no you typed it wrong i knew it oh it's still okay is it working yeah oh there's redirects going on actually this one also works oh wow wait you can type it without a minus it redirects to this wow maybe because i'm too famous yeah yeah you can just like get oh you can just put the name on it that's probably why it's my target so much fun i understood german directly yeah but i also do i also have some videos with typing tests so if you just want to hear the sound of a modded or unmodded keyboard you can also check it out for sure that's cool um constant then do you have something you want to share to the audience even though it's not that many people now um no it's rise of right now though i'll probably share it on twitter at some point but yeah sure nothing related i mean i have my i have my blog post about how to be on the keyboard um so i can maybe share that one yeah if you can put it in the chat here i'll put it um in the in the public chat if some people are interested into building their own it's like quite old uh uh but it's quite timeless right this stuff yeah i know i'm just saying that like the quality of the pictures and so on is not like the best uh but yeah it's it's still relevant as of today um yeah oh yeah looking at it it's quite unacceptable no i'm just kidding i know also like it was um it's also like a not so expensive one uh i'm talking about the price and also how you can make it cheaper yeah nice oh but you go in depth it's really nice awesome um guys thank you so much this was great thank you for your time two hours of your day talking about keyboards which is probably pretty good past time to be honest next time maybe you have a drink with it um thanks again yeah that way you know what to do on your weekend oh yeah i'm gonna have to do some research on what kind of keycaps i want and what kind of switches like i have to browns now and oh oh oh oh oh tell me what color should i go for what is like blue is more clicky right i would i would not think about colors because when you go into the custom also keys or switch topic it's not about the color just look for if you go to linear tactile or clicky like clicky is the really loud click normally tactile is a really like a bump in between between top and bottom out there's a bump in between this tactile and linear is like what it says linear like from top to bottom straight through and then there's all the different in betweens of where's the actuation point um does the does the spring even have like two different uh strengthness points on it is it is it is it uh like weaker on the on the top and stronger in the bottom and and everything so okay this is the next stream perhaps because it feels like we can actually dive into that yeah yeah definitely all right i'll just go to a meet-up maybe that's better right yeah just try it my community is also organizing some meetups so there's one happening in the north of germany and i think it's next week in four weeks they are doing something in khalsa which is more to the south of germany and i am in the process of re-installing a whole conference of keyboards in germany because there was one until 2018 and there's nothing now but i have so many manufacturers right now are like closer to me so i can ask them to also show their stuff and maybe make make a talk or speech about it so there's there might be something coming that's very interesting but constantine the one in um paris is september first you said third okay let me see if i if that's enough for me to go because i still have a storage unit in paris that needs to be emptied because it's too expensive so who knows maybe i can make a trip yeah also it's like the world day uh and you also can get some prices i mean um last time i went there uh we had to pick like a random number and i won so it's like yeah if you want to to go back at home with like a keycap or a t-shirt or whatever yeah nice also nice if you're exactly lucky why not all right that's a nice way to end um thank you guys so much this was great cheers thank you bye bye nice evening"
