transcript: "[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] how are you hello what's up all good how about you good good Okay cool so Tim thanks for joining us on the webinar and good hi everyone um so my name is Joshua so I'm the co-founder and CEO of hm um so in today's webinar we are going to share an inspiring customer Journey a story of creating a unique Avatar and averaging agent to create Successful video marketing strategy so um you know having uh videos marketing strategy in place will improve your marketing team's efficiency and lead to an unlimited possibility for creativity so a successful strategy will significantly reduce the time and expense um associated with creating content in-house so like yeah today we will uh we are honored to have Team here so um team is one of the um the best video creator uh video marketer I've ever met so oh wow team okay it's coming from uniform Yeah Tim do you want to give you a quick give the audience a quick intro about yourself yeah sure yeah thanks yeah I was actually quite excited to see what you would say about what uniform does but that's that's a tricky one so I'll take it so my name is Tim Bennett and um I work for a company called uniform and I am in the marketing team but my title is director of developer relations so I'm essentially in charge of how do you Market to developers and developers tend to be people who don't like marketing so what do you do to still make them happy and do conversion and things like that and so I'm based in France so for me it's evening I just had my dinner which was then early because the the stream is at the dinner time essentially but I'm really excited to be here and talk a little bit about um what we do for this developer relations stuff with video and marketing in this B2B space because at uniform we work in the same space as where you have things like Atlas cms's or content management or how do you assign a certain design to your data and make that accessible for people but for developers both developers and marketers and content creators and so I won't go too deep in what the company does but what you should know is that it's business to business marketing essentially awesome awesome yeah that's great so um yeah before we started the um um a couple conversations so Tim do you mind we share some of the um the Avatar videos that you you have made uh before of course uh with the audience so yeah yeah cool awesome so Joy if you could uh help to share some of the uh Link in the comments so I think um some of the uh audience can take a look at that so uh I have to be I have to say okay I'm actually very jealous that you have a such amazing art I think if the app that you have is even better than mine oh no to get a better one uh but anyway so um yeah you guys can check out the link from the comment section and and I guess we can get started with uh a couple of uh interviews so here um sure yeah the first question I would have is that you know um what would be the most significant problem or pain point you have faced in the video marketing creation process actually well what we are seeing is that we we have learned and in our space especially that video really converts well for people people tend to enjoy it it's it you know it's it gives you Joy when you watch them and then you might want to check out what you're doing because sometimes people just scroll by in a feed and they see a video and they do something with it rather than just some text right so we know that if we have a good idea we repurpose it and we do a lot of different types of video and so the essential problem is just time and resource literally like the I actually I've noticed now the consistency of doing more is actually almost more important than what's in the video and of course within the video needs to be correct and it needs to be good but the fact that you have lots of it in the right direction to the Right audience is very very important and then so it's time and resources but what that also means is I cannot have a colleague of mine be me and make a video for me I literally need to clone myself and I guess you know where this is going right but yeah I need more of me to be able to do it and also the nature of being in a product company means product updates we literally release every day documentation changes resources change videos are out of date in like a month so sometimes it's been very nice rather than to reshoot that they can just change the script and we're good again and so Diamond Resource for sure and then one last thing I also thought about is like what you actually want to do is for certain groups personalize your video right mentioned brand mention their types of customers and you can of course do this but I'm a team of one right I I don't have the resource in a reasonable time frame to actually last video for different audiences garlic garlic so it's time and resource I mean while it gave us an ability to like personalize that yeah exactly yeah that's great so I think when you mentioned you know I think definitely in in uniform space it's definitely I think uh probably one of the most fast-pacing uh internship that you guys are in you need to exactly update the documentation every day right I think we we have seen some similar um uh pain points on our product as well we also have this black we did up with this every day but we kind of agree with this like weekly bi-weekly yeah the amount of new features you guys put out is crazy and they're all good they're not full of bugs and I'm in the place where we do the same so I I know how you feel about that and you need to be able to somehow Market that right yeah exactly and and also uh we we we create a lot of like uh those like tutorials videos on YouTube right um yeah definitely some of them are already outdated um but yeah if I can create using the other to do that it's easy to use in nature to just make some updates or maybe maybe even update some of the you know uh uh screenshot um let's screen recording over there yeah so cool um yeah um and then and then another thing Tim so you mentioned you would like to have a way uh have your colleagues or your team to actually be able to use you as the uh person to create a video like um is that because you are being the brand ambassador or the the identity person of uniform and how does it work today well there's a few different approaches here I'm not the only prolific person at that company that speaks for the company we have Founders in the same position as you that also will do video and we also have a few other people like our enablement and our sdrs and for the people who don't know um sdrs are people that either deal with inbound prospects that might want to buy your product or they reach out to specific people and having video for them is amazing right or they need some personalized video so and they tend to have very specific ideas of what about what they want to say if they can just use me then to do that that works really well because I've done this for a while in in the space where I work I've been there for a long time and people know me so when they see my face and they say something that has a base trust and then of course you have to say smart things otherwise it doesn't work but at least having this base trust you can reuse that right and so I'm not saying I want my colleagues to make a completely new video from scratch with me because that might go slightly off in what how I would say certain things right but if an edit needs to happen I don't want to have to re-record I just want to send my colleague in and say hey this term this terminology has changed now so while while I do a live stream with hey Jin like this I want my colleague to then update the script and re-render the video and then we're good to go so it makes sense in in the end if you're in a startup that's series a you want to run fast do more in parallel and the more in parallel you can do the more you know you can just test more see what sticks better which messaging works because in a young company you can still have messaging that doesn't work and you just go to the next time and try it again well if you can try it on a few different places at the same time why not [Music] um actually you mentioned one very interesting concept that tests out whether the message can work I want to go deeper on that but before that like um so could you share about uh it's possible could you share about um what would be the video strategy um or the content strategy searches you are you guys are running like could you provide an overview of that well what I can definitely do that in this scope of the marketing and then also the developer related stuff that that's that's what I'm doing right and so generally what we have noticed is that when you do one-off videos they can work but it's not guaranteed and so what we tend to do now is we have bigger ideas that are overarching for our product and that can either be related to a campaign we're starting like or perhaps like a new product release and then so we have ideas about how to talk about a certain campaign like for um hey gen it could be no more camera no more team is needed do it all with an avatar that's actually your campaign that's a great slogan and you run from there and then what we do is we have one good idea and then we make a few content pieces that really explain that idea and then re repurpose everything so make shorter Clips make longer videos make thought leadership pieces written but also make them spoken to live streams to webinars um you know teaching things and then bring it all back with the same themes and maybe even in enablement and Outreach by the sdrs and so the main idea is that everything you do fits in a certain Journey that we want our customers to potentially go into and in our case that could be okay you have an old system and you want to go into the modern world where the more composable system towards how you make content management work well that's an ALT to new track another track could be you already have a new system but you didn't do it right and you're stuck how can you then fix that well that's another one or some are much closer to what how marketers feel when they work and something is really complicated how do we make it simpler or on the developer track that's more for me is you have coded everything together and it's really quite tight and you cannot move forward anymore how do you fix it so there's all these themes we want people to go into and then we make great pieces of content that's like that fit in there and then we repurpose garlic that's the approach got it so if I understand correctly you have multiple theme and which maybe representing multiple campaign right and and usually for even for one theme you could have multiple iterations of messaging and you're gonna test out for the market yeah the other day we were talking about how we can uh improve the messaging uh on on the product messaging stuff yeah so I think that's a pretty good idea you know and yeah so and videos kind of like the um essential pieces of their campaign like you create that and then you guys like have the team everybody interestingly the essential piece is the why so there's a little story there's like a paragraph and then of course we have great product marketing people that know how to write these lines like uh I don't know specific stuff about being able to be faster to build a website in in our space right and so we have the concept we write down a paragraph we write down a few sentences that really do that and then they go on our home page and then they go in our Outreach email and then from that having this theme then you can suddenly start to make different types of videos because a video can be a little tutorial about a feature that fits in that theme but it can also be a thought leadership piece that doesn't even mention the brand but it talks about the problem of what you might have and that that might be a bridge into some other things about what I do because when you Market to developers specifically they don't really like all the buzzwords and especially not mentioning the brand too much because they don't want to be stroll the brand they want to understand what's the problem and how do I solve it in my context and do I like the person or the company and what they stand for like how are they represented what is their perception um and so that's really my place is okay how do I make a video that is not just shouting evangelism use this use this use this developers will just go away they will not like that so you tend to speak more about what are the problems in the space and how might you solve it and then I am the person that represents that company and they know that about me because I'm a public-facing figure and then they might figure out hey where does this person work let's check that out and I use that to the max like I even did a conference talk where I play guitar on stage but I build a guitar karaoke system in the browser so all the technology that I use in the browser to do karaoke with my guitar life on stage in front of like 1500 people use the technology where I work and that gave more conversion than anything saying the word I work at uniform yeah right so you need to find that balance a little bit Yeah and CPO goes in many directions with that makes sense makes sense core so um that's great so yeah let's switch back to one the other question about yeah sorry I went fast oh no no definitely okay so let's switch back to the the AI right so Timmy I think you have been expressing uh testing a lot of different AI Tools in this area not only attention but uh definitely a lot of them yeah let me ask a simple question like like this team will AI replace you oh that's that's an interesting question isn't it because it probably will even though I don't like that it's you know what um there's so many like podcasts now that talk about what AI will do and how we underestimate it now already imagine how far hey gen has come in like six months it's almost not imaginable how fast that went and how good it is and so I'm I think it will but it might not have all the contacts that I have in my history and my Humanity towards how other people think about how I speak about things you know what I might say that now I said something like this when we had GPT 3.5 and then 4.0 came out and everything I said was invalidated that's at the space of a week so I'm gonna stay away a little bit from mentioning all that stuff what do you think personally being much closer to the stuff than I am yeah I think like um it would definitely replace some of uh some component of the work that we are doing but I also create new possibilities yeah that's that's generally my view right um like for example it it definitely replace my job in terms of like filming the video for the company uh released our product interview it says faces me tons of time I used to still do the um voice recording myself because that voice cologne is not uh to that level yet but we we we have a new voice cologne um version now it's actually pretty good and I cannot wait yeah you should try that but I no longer need to do the voice recording anymore so uh yeah I think things are are evolving towards that direction but meanwhile we definitely we create more uh possibilities um more work right in terms of oh someone actually need to do to more videos and do strategic thinking um do you prompt engineering and stuff like that yeah accessible Channel review yeah yeah just you need to learn about how to use it to make it best of it essentially because like my whole career I've been a coder and I'm generally working on the front end side of things so building how your website looks behaves and works when you click add to basket I've built that that stuff when it stabilizes a bit more because you can see now there's lots of technical Frameworks out there now for coding that become so feature-rich it's almost normalized and almost everybody cannot just take one of these Frameworks and build an amazing experience I come from the time where nothing existed and we had to invent it right well now that these Frameworks are here and they all have kind of normalized how things work the performance is all there accessibility is all there if an AI model starts to learn how to use these Frameworks or choose the right framework for its benefit or whatever that kind of work the relatively simple stuff it will be gone and so we just need to be able to use it and because this is what you always see in Myspace where people spend a lot of time building configuring coding and not as much time on telling the story what if you didn't have to code as much and you could spend all your time on telling the story you're going to get a lot better campaigns better conversion better personalization it will just all be better make sense yeah definitely cool and so I think come come back to Haitian so Tim how how are you using hey um I kind of want to understand a bit more about um the use cases as well things right so um could you talk about how you're using agent in like which area that you're using and also in the future what are the areas that you think marketers can use agent uh for their uh use case well I think starting with what I'm doing now which is still relatively simple but with big impact especially like I just mentioned right we have this theme that fits in a certain swim Lane let's say and we come up with the content and then we need to make smaller chunks within that and um a recent video I think that was posted in the chat here was one on where we have this talking track called hatless 2.0 right so now we have software as a service software that doesn't have front-end development needs it's just data that comes out I'm not going to go too deep into the tech because I know not everybody in this in the Stream is super technical in the space that I am they probably are in Q in Ai and stuff but anyways so we came up with a thing we call Atlas 2.0 the new way of doing it oh that's one of those talk tracks right and so I had to come up with a thing that was one where I really talked about how uniform does that how it all fits in and then I had to make one a video or talk track about the general problems we see with the 1.0 version how you might potentially fix it um those kind of things are literally talk tracks that I need to make videos on that each people in the space about thought leadership so that's one but then when you talk more about the marketing side of things and just having the content out there in different ways because my colleague Mickey is actually in the chat and what he's saying is like some people just don't like reading blogs right even if it's only 800 words well what we could do is actually make a script using some AI tool from blog to video script and then push it into heygen and make a video on it in one minute and stuff like that or we I have also have things where let's say I'm speaking at a conference and I do that all the time I spoke at one today even before this and then we had a live stream and stuff like that people scroll by on their LinkedIn feed on their Twitter feed stuff like that and what they respond to are videos if I could make like 16 tiny videos with like two sentences that say Hey I'm Tim I work at uniform and I speak here about blah blah blah that converts a lot better than writing a post and having an image so there's all these smaller things that you can put in place that you then don't have to record all the time but it's just there and you make an update and there's another video so that's kind of how we use it now but for the future I have bigger plans I think there's a lot more we can do and this goes slightly outside of the scope of marketing well it's still marketing you you could call it different things but like at uniform we are moving a little bit more into the direction of sales let growth which means we know our target audience we know a customer and we are tailoring our sales process to that customer well with that comes onboarding specific to them there's enablement teaching them about features specific to them so what that means is you can make courses with slides behind and a narrator in front with an avatar Pro for example behind with a green screen that explains certain things specifically to them wouldn't it be awesome if you can after a meeting send them an email with a video about a feature talking to them from the person that just had that meeting with them right so you can kind of personalize these things for people and then if a script needs to change you can just switch it up for another customer or maybe different features or maybe a feature was updated imagine we do a product release that is big enough to Warrant a press release or something well why don't you make 20 different videos for a different customer with slightly different context and just send it out as an email blast that's perfect so that's the one end and then on the other side there's something called SDR so these are basically yeah I don't want to butcher the term because it's not my actual job but my colleague Natalie is amazing at it and so essentially what she's doing is she has a bunch of people that understand the market and they know with this product that we have this this part will speak to these five companies and they have these specific problems and what they do is they either do Outreach to specifically say I probably know you have this problem let me make a video for you specifically to you no problem and then explain that and then because video gets conversion right and they also sometimes deal with inbounds and figure out these people need these kind of things let me now make a chain of a few emails and all have a video talking specifically to a subject well that personalization is going to win the game in the future and we can use hey Jen for all of it May sense yeah that's exciting yeah when you mentioned the SDR and also the onboarding uh uh pieces yeah I I get the same feeling um you know um we are actually planning to uh send out um unique onboarding video um why not right it's perfect my avatar and it can tell us specific to that person you know and I will be talking to them and welcome them up to the platform right and another thing I think would be very related I think a lot of SDR team members are using room to actually yeah customers right so I think yeah what one thing I'm thinking about I I by the way I also use a lot of the like for customers same here I think we have like 15 looms a day where at uniform maybe more wow wow a lot of Journal external everywhere yeah yeah exactly yes when sometimes people are having some question about the API I just did a room because it's just much easier just like too many um a couple of minutes but just imagine that if we can have a way to automate that right so it would be um my avatar and I just like do some typing and just like uh send it or all the way down to the CRM system yeah that would be amazing yeah exactly and you know what even for the future you could even think further where you can use your API to write something to the API and in real time my avatar says that to someone like this is chat box chatbot 2.0 right it's pretty interesting stuff yeah makes sense cool and um cool so my last question would be Tim um how is your uh audience reaction to the Avatar do they love it do they even know this Avatar um yeah it's really interesting right it's pure Magic like it there's there's let's say there's two real reactions in the outside world and there's one that's my wife that says your eyes are not the same yeah of course you know me so well of course my eyes are not exactly the same and you know what they might be but she just thinks hey this is AI so this is different but let's let's put that one on the side so either people don't know it's an AI and they're broadly fine just consuming the content or they do know it and they're like this is too good to be true what's happening to the world right so those are like both of those and that's it's just very interesting to see where even my colleague Mickey using the chat here um I made this video about this headless 2.0 thing and I send it to him in the morning he just was on this phone watched it and they're like okay that's just it's a cool video and then done nothing else and I just spoke to me a little bit like watch it again I said yeah it's fine so this was my avatar right and so if you make it like and there's a few things maybe I'd love to talk a lot a little bit about you know features that I might want but I'm not sure how that would work yet because if you actually look at this Avatar and you you see it talk for like five minutes you will figure out that it's not real yet right because in between sentences it might move its head away you might not do that because it's just the model learning right yeah I imagine if you throw another week at it it's better but that's another thing and but what would be very interesting and I'm not sure how that would be possible but to have an avatar light where in the script you can say emote like this and then a sentence later emote like that the moment you get a bit more control over how when do I move my hands when do my eyes light up when do I smile more the moment you can do more of that and you can control that in the script it's unbeatable it makes sense yeah we definitely so um yeah this this is why I mentioned Tim you have a avatar that made me jealous I think Avatar is really good uh thanks yeah yeah coming back to to your uh feedback uh yeah we are working on that um we will yeah exactly like you said we want to bake it um like the gesture the movement control uh into the text so that it just make a stimulus right um yeah yeah cool um I guess that's it so thank you very much Tim uh on joining us today so um I guess last piece is we will probably take a couple questions from the audience and then um yeah so let me see what yeah I saw one here one of the three top feedback points on a digital Avatar I think we kind of talked about that already like what percentages of people didn't think it was a real human I think when you tell people they all see it but if you don't and like we did a few very interesting tests where I speak at one uh conference all the time for the last few years and they have thousands of followers and we just made an Instagram Reel with like fun edits and zoom ins and things like that just talking about what my job is and he sent it out to all these people and nobody replied hey this is weird there's an uncanny family here not at all so it can work and I see a fun question here about The Uncanny Valley in heyjin and you know what if you do it right with your avatar light hey The Uncanny Valley is gone but you really need to know how to make this Avatar recording and then the model will just be good enough but I've had a few avatars where you've definitely see The Uncanny Valley and it's like the deaths there sometimes when you pause and you look too much in the camera or the lips are a little bit awkward that's because I was looking down when I was saying something yeah after all your feedback I made my own like after that I I really took my posture and then very calculated and you can see it's a little calculated that's true so I but The Uncanny pheli is kind of gone now so the one thing I would do right now to kind of hack it is actually make three avatars identical looking like this right now one where I move my hands a lot one where I really smile bright eyes and everything and one where I'm really serious and then record a video script with the three avatars and then just on my my MacBook cut and paste the different chunks I think if I do that you can probably not tell it's fake I say interesting because I'm just hacking your system already it's just a little costly to do it that way but you can definitely do it I think yeah that might actually work um yeah interesting so I haven't thought about it actually um but but I think you mentioned one thing um like I think one of the audience asked about whether we or whether lives you know uncanny value right so yeah I'm really confident that we are um yeah there's no uncanny valid problem um if we do it right but yeah it is really hard to do it right right now it is some of the problem we need to solve as a company um do you think you need more time in the model or do you need better Source material I don't think we need more time we just like need a better Source material like for example uh we definitely cannot have the um the the footage just can look down or look that way uh something like that yeah otherwise it's okay yeah yeah it's it's you see some strange things sometimes when you speak and then the sentence is done or before I start speaking my head does this and then it starts speaking that's just because this was one of my mannerisms yeah in another timing and so it needs to start learning I guess when does this person do that and in what context and that's just really hard to know if the source material doesn't actually tell the model this it's almost impossible yeah makes sense yeah cool and I guess another question uh from the audience I was asking asking about the voice column uh being the American accent yeah so um yeah Brad could you send us an email we have a new version now uh uh uh we can I can connect the team with you to give it a try so it will have uh it will have the ability to mimic your accent I really want this because now I I overed up all my videos I I see yeah I did that before as well cool um yeah because we are not very American in that sense we have accents so yeah yeah Brad please make sure you send us an email I will connect you uh from the to the table and yeah and then another question is about how about improving Spanish speaking voice model um yeah that's the um we definitely keep improving the uh The Voice model but uh specifically what aspect of the Spanish speaking model you're talking about uh yeah if you could send us an email follow-up we can follow up with you um yeah so and then the last question would be are these people real or AI advertise yeah so yeah I mean for sure we are definitely real here but I I kind of like thinking about because I'm in the space but in the future it may not matter that much whether it's me or my avatar are joining the webinar or during the video right so because my answer will be as good as uh like as good as looking at me as a realistic it could be and meanwhile he would be able to actually consume all my thinking all the contents that I put out there and then he kind of like have a it's a digital clone of me yeah so uh yeah so I think that would be very interesting um to see what happened in the next yeah how would you answer this one then because for me personally how I work I have a ton of experience in speaking for cameras and doing all that stuff and lots of it is on gut feel how I feel that day or you know whatever questions you ask me will an AI be able to cover my ups and downs that I constantly have so if so it needs a lot of data it needs to know about my life because how can it know on gut field sometimes I have a different answer to the same question two weeks in between because I feel differently so I'm I'm wondering if it can get that far because you know it probably will let's be honest right yeah so I think it will actually in my opinion like from the technology standpoint right if you look at GPT um it kind of have some coffee as well that the answer is like not the same right every time uh it really depends on uh like he's you know um the the time you send it and the next time you do it again it will be different and you even you look at the voice technology they are they are true as well like you have your voice Alone um basically not every time the input you will get exactly the same output they are just different as well yeah if we try to put this on the timeline right so the text audio and the next thing we're gonna be video very soon right um and if yeah it's just like some randomization over there and if we have enough data I think it would be able to incorporate some of the uh like like the Garfield that you you personally have yeah so yeah that would be very interesting to see what will happen in the next slide six months yeah imagine right um like the Tim Ferriss podcast the super famous ones or like if a few other ones I imagine within a year they'll be interviewing AIS that have their own personality what do you think wow that that would be very cool but then we need an AGI first probably yeah I'm not sure but I don't know like I think the crazy thing I think about slide is uh Tim it's like if I I'm gonna have my avatar to have a meeting with you right and you don't need to meet with me we can just let your after me right um and and their conversation that doesn't have to be half an hour it could be one second they talk about everything they need oh this is crazy man right it's just like doing the knowledge transfer and then he can then come back to talk to explain to me okay uh what I learned from teams Avatar um and then yeah something like that it's crazy but we already see some of this right you see somebody who wants to write a big email so they go to copy.ai which is one of the the the partners you guys have I think then it asks you ask them write me and in this in this um you know our company language write me an email like this they will so that email is sent and then the person receiving it will also go to copy AI paste that email and say write this to me in a few you know bullet points in whatever they really meant like that transformation is constantly happening already imagine if that has made simpler is going to be great yeah will people ever really read write and read something properly anymore I don't know it might not be needed cool yeah anyways awesome cool yeah thank you thank you very much Tim uh for the time uh it's a great uh conversation yeah enjoy enjoy talking to you today so uh lastly so uh for all the audience um please feel free to fill in the form and you can earn a five minute gift critics about hey Jen uh yeah so I guess that's it so see you guys uh next week I think Tim have a good night you do cheers have a good day bye-bye cool bye-bye [Music] thank you"
