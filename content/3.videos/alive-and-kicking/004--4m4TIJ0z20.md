title: Tim Benniks - Alive and Kicking. A Vue into Rock& Roll! - Vuejs Amsterdam 2023
description: |-
  Rock & roll is alive and kicking and in this talk I will showcase that Vue is so versatile it can be used to do audio visualisations while rock guitar soars through the browser. The audience will have access to a vue application which allows them to vote for a song to be played live on stage. The screen shows all the votes and I play them as they come up. While playing music meta data is shown and an audio visualisation plays while I’m rocking on stage. The more votes a song gets, the higher it shows on the list and the more chance I’ll play it. The whole experience is created using Vue and Uniform. Next to waking the audience up with some spicy rock& roll, I will explain how the software was build and why Vue is such an important technology for composable architectures with multiple channels.
