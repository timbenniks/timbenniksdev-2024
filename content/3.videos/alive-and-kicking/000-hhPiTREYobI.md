title: The story behind Alive and kicking
description: |-
  After a guitar hiatus of 10 years, I played a gig in front of 1000 people, without a band, all on my own. The browser controlled everything, from the backing tracks to the visualization, to the guitar amp presets. Users could live-vote on which song I played next.

  Tech used:
  * Vue.js
  * Nuxtjs
  * Pinia
  * Vercel
  * Supabase
  * Webmidi.js
  * Cloudinary
