  After a guitar hiatus of 10 years, I played a gig in front of 1000 people, without a band, all on my own. The browser controlled everything, from the backing tracks to the visualization, to the guitar amp presets. Users could live-vote on which song I played next.

transcript: cool [Applause] [Music] about yourself [Music] over time things sometimes just kind of musically for me at least they go down in the back of my mind is like there's this guitar I need to play it but not today and not today became the last seven eight years like I would get it up noodle a bit put it back but that's not making music that's just noodling I don't know what it is sometimes some spark needs to go off somewhere and I have it back now and I'm so happy I speak at all these conferences right and I wanted to kind of shake things up with different things that I do people that watch this probably know me as someone who is a developer who speaks at conferences makes YouTube videos but all that music stuff is not that on the foreground with me and I wanted to change that because it's my passion actually my music is a bigger passion than anything else you've ever seen of me online there has to be a way with modern technology that I can grab a guitar plug it into an audio interface that with USB talks to my computer and then the rest happens there I had this idea of you know what I'm going to do guitar karaoke myself on stage using the technology that people use at that conference so I pitched this idea to Yos from qds Amsterdam my dear friend who is always ready to hear crazy ideas for me and I said you know what I'm gonna have the audience vote and they fought on four or five songs and whatever song gets voted on I play on stage no matter what happens it's going to be awesome and he's like you're crazy it's ambitious but let's go we're gonna do this and so I wrote down what it's going to be and they did Big Marketing and it was like oh boy I actually didn't check how am I going to actually pull this off is there technology that with a browser can talk to my guitar and change the sound turns out it's not that hard [Music] right [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] backstage it's like 7am I'm dead it's really early but Rock life goes on I thought I'd just warm up my fingers and like just rocking with it you know small setup all we need in one of the backstage areas which is basically a shipping container so anyways let's rock and roll you have your phone and you're in the audience you log in with GitHub you fold on whatever song you want that I for me to play you get three votes there's five songs and the moment you vote you see your little GitHub um profile icon fly about on the screen because it's fun to see stuff live and whatever song gets the most votes I click play on the backing track starts to play through the laptop then I put my guitar on top of that and both go out to the output and then there's music foreign [Applause] are you awake yet no I can guarantee you you will be after this it's Gonna Get Loud and this is actually a pretty different talk than you're used to okay so super bass is actually dealing with the amount of votes more more more more you get three photos out of five songs right oh we have lots of Michael Jackson AC DC obviously look at all these boats so it's going to be so much fun waking up the crowd opening this lovely conference with some you know party because I want some interaction there and I want to just like this is Tim I like music I like nerd stuff I like coding I guess I've been thinking about this project for a few years now [Music] welcome [Music] same I have not seen a guitar this good in a long time it has like a roasted Maple neck you can see it's darker so it's not moving as much it has a floating tremolo um it has locking tuners I can play Blues on it I can play any sort of Pop tune because it it has all these features so um I'll be using this on stage because it's so versatile [Applause] [Music] let's go foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] to extract isolated tracks for Focus guitars drums whatever from these songs that I'm playing I removed all the guitars and all the extras I cut up the song to be two minutes and I replayed all the guitars myself as a Bass track for me to play over on stage and so I just opened GarageBand free tool on a MacBook works perfectly and so I essentially kind of re-recorded all these songs with my own guitars and cutting them up and then using some original parts some my of my own Parts some programmed Parts just to make these songs my own and really great for at the conference and I had some help from Nicolette bruntner who is the production manager at few DS Amsterdam and she's actually a trained audio engineer she's amazing at mixing and recording and so we were chatting all the time like how does this have to sound how would I do that and I gave her all the tracks and she did this insanely good mix for me that I didn't expect her to put so much time [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] look at all these boats go [Applause] foreign [Music]
