title: "Vue.js guitar karaoke: how I built it"
description: |-
  In this video, I explain how I created a Vue.js guitar karaoke system in which the browser controls everything. #vuejs and #nuxtjs deal with backing tracks, visualization, and guitar amp presets with midi. Users live-vote on which song I play next using #supabase.

  The talk is called Alive and Kicking, a Vue into rock & roll. I did this talk in front of 1000 people at @VuejsAmsterdam in February 2023.

  The code is open source: https://github.com/timbenniks/AliveAndKickingTalk
