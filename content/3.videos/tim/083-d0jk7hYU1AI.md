description: "After a not-so-great experience with Azure Functions previously I decided to revisit them for version 3.0. Conclusion: AWESOME.

Microsoft nailed the developer experience here I and I'll definitely be combining Azure Functions and Azure Static Web Apps in the future.\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.nl/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks\n\n#azurefunctions #javascript #vscode"
