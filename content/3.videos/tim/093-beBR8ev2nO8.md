title: "Weight loss with Serveless architecture and the JAMstack"
description: "What do Serverless and JAMstack have to do with weight loss? Well, in my case, a lot!\n\nTo be able to loose weight I need a good incentive. And for me that incentive is public accountability. I have created a #Vue.js PWA app called \"Fatty\" that is built on a serverless architecture and the JAMstack. The app shows how much weight I have lost and it tweets an update into the world every time I step on my WiFi enabled scale. In this video I explain how it all connects!\n\nNext to talking about the tech that powers the Fatty app I also tell about my fitness story. If I can loose all that weight than you can as well.\n\nRead about Fatty here: https://timbenniks.nl/writings/fatty-is-alive/\nSee Fatty in action: https://fatty.timbenniks.com\nMore on my fitness story: https://timbenniks.nl/writings/my-fitness-story/\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.nl/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks\n\n#jamstack #serverless"
