transcript: "[Music] it is now 543 in the morning and I'm on my way to Austin Texas cuz I'm speaking at content con and so let's just start driving anyways and because I have 24 hours of travel ahead that's why I'm this early all normally I speak at a conference just you know to to talk about the tech right now nope I have 15 probably 20 minutes to play my guitar go off stage and be gone anyways um I cannot keep driving like this so um let's make a montage shall we because this is 24 hours for d for travel anyways cheers [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so I haven't even talked about what I'm actually doing here at the conference because I did mention a little bit like I'm going to play guitar right on the entertainment and so actually um I'm coming here to do my Alive and Kicking talk which is basically a guitar karaoke where people can phote on what songs I play and together we make a mashup of four songs and then I play all the songs and the fun bit of course is that I'm using um technology that's all in the cloud it's hatless it's all in the browser and so it really fits a conference like this where I use the technology that they sell but I don't explain how to do it I actually just show you this is a way you can use it right and so because I'm traveling all the way here all the flights and stuff I couldn't bring a guitar because that's just really challenging to do and so I get here I buy a guitar and then we buy a nice flight case and then we send it back and so going back with the guitar is a lot safer than coming here because I come here and something goes wrong we're screwed essentially and so I'm going to buying a guitar now yeah [Music] [Music] now that is an awesome guitar I'm really really excited to use it so thank you content stack for actually um helping me get that and so after buying it um I went out on the town I saw a few people we had some lovely food and then we had a great um speakers dinner and then we went out for some whiskies and Good Times [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] more often V again try to hack it please I ask this on every conference and based on the audience they either hack it or they don't [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you"
