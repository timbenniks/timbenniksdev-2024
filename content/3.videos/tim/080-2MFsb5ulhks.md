title: "Vue.js Global conference: An interview with Maria Lamardo"
description: "In this video I'm interviewing Maria Lamardo. Maria is a web developer with a specialty in #accessibility and #Vuejs. We talk a little about her Vue.js Global conference talk which basically covers me asking her annoying questions about forms and accessibility. After covering the conference talk we dive into her unconventional path into tech and how she became so good at her job. I'm very impressed by Maria and our conversation goes quite deep. If you are someone who wants to potentially switch careers, watch this interview.\n\nThis video is made in collaboration with the Vue.js Global conference. \nMore details here: https://vuejs.amsterdam \n\nFollow Maria here:\nhttps://twitter.com/MariaLamardo\nhttps://twitter.com/world_vue\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.nl/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks\n\n#interview"
