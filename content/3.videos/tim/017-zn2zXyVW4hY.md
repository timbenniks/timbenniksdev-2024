transcript: "as a professional content creator at a startup let's say you're in a marketing team or in a developer relations team you have to create a ton of video content to see what sticks right you set your strategy at the beginning of let's say a quarter you try out the messaging you do all the different things and once it works you repeat this is kind of the awareness bit of being in marketing right and so me as a devrel I do a lot of these type of videos I make feature videos about the product or subject matter expert discussion videos about certain subjects there's a whole bunch of stuff that you keep having to do and I just don't have enough time in my day to literally do all that content so what if I could clone myself and script these videos and have ai help me out with both the scripts and the video that would be amazing right well it works you're literally looking at my clone right now this is not me you might have seen a little bit of The Uncanny Valley going on right this stuff is getting better and better and today I want to show you how I use the tool called Hey gen to figure all this stuff out alright let's get into it all right so this is the hey gen website and I just went to the features page and so essentially what they do is they you can write some text and then it has your avatar or an avatar that you choose and it will just speak that and look relatively natural and it's very close to being indistinguishable from real and so um you can create your own avatar either a professional one that has like a proper cutout like on a green screen or an avatar light that's the one that I'm using which is literally this video setting and then I get to speak and animate and that's what they actually do for you as well it's very very interesting you can also kind of face swap different faces on videos and even upload a picture that will then be animated in the face based on what you write or add audio to which is ridiculously awesome it actually really works pretty well and so there's lots of um different extra tools that they have for like different languages different voices voice cloning or existing voices different you know tools to be able to edit your video in the platform I personally don't really use that stuff because I want it to be very much my own custom stuff but you can if you wanted to make a whole um series on teaching something in hey gen completely so let's go into the dashboard and so here you can see this is my avatar I have two of them they call this an avatar light and so um you can see these are literally videos that I recorded for like four or five minutes just me speaking giving some breaks looking into the camera looking away moving my arms a bit and it just gave that to the AI model and it made me work so incredibly well that's exactly it's it's almost me like the lips are not fully the same but give it a few months and it's extremely close and so you can also have an avatar Pro which is you can see a lot of those right you can kind of choose from them and the amazing thing is you can actually type a prompt and give them a different outfit it's ridiculous like all these things are so cool nowadays anyways for me um I tend to use the Avatar lights let's just take this one make a landscape video and so what I tend to do because my voice is weird my accent is weird right I work in English with Americans mainly I live in France but I was born in the Netherlands in Amsterdam so I have a amalgamation of three things in one voice and AI is not ready for that even with a voice clone because they tend to have an American model that I put my tonality on and so if I wanted to I could actually grab my voice and select that and write something out and that would actually work pretty well um however that feels a little bit artificial if you know me if you don't know me I'm just an American or a French speaking guy with my first voice tonality but what I love about what hey Jen has done is you can actually go here and say audio script so you can record something let's say in your laptop clean that up with some other AI tools so it sounds pristine upload it here and it will move the lips according to that and that just works incredibly well and during the viewing of this video while I edit it you will be seeing me and then the AI Avatar speaking what I'm saying now because I have this audio and can just give it to hey Jen and what I'll do as well is I'll just grab this one hit play for a sec so it has actually rendered all of that stuff and so now it has done this and now I can actually hit submit and what it will do now it will actually render a video of me saying that with my voice in an American accent so I'll put that in so you can also hear that a little bit welcome to the new era of video Creation with hey Jen simply type your script to get started um and so this is such a strong technology that I have now cloned myself and if I wanted to I could dive even deeper make different edits in these videos and do the whole thing here but I tend to go to DaVinci Resolve and do my own stuff just because I'm a nerd and I like it but anyways um you should go and try hey Jen if you're a content creator because they keep adding new features like every month and it just gets better and better and better and it's almost ridiculous anyway that's what I wanted to show you today cheers"
