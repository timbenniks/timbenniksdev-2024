title: "Make your website even faster with Astro!"
description: "Now that we have figured out that #Jamstack sites are the fastest out there, the JavaScript bundles they ship have become the bottleneck. JavaScript bundles need to be downloaded, parsed and executed by the browser. Lot's of people now who have phablets and loading a regular React or Vue app is actually slow due to the JavaScript they output.\n\nWhat if you could build a website with your favourite framework but choose exactly which bits of JavaScript end up on the client?\n\nEnter Astro.\n\nWith the ability to choose what JavaScript the user has to load and when, Astro is paving a new way of web development. In my opinion this is the future.\n\nCheck out my code here: https://github.com/timbenniks/astro-vue\n\nI used Astro, Vue, React, Prismic and Tailwind for the demo.\n\nhttps://astro.build\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.dev\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks"
