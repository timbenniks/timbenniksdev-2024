title: "Tim Tries: Storyblok. One of the best headless content editing experiences"
description: "Sometimes I try out new tech or web services for the first time. I give feedback as I go, in real-time. This is the #timtries Series. In this episode I try out the #Storyblok, the headless CMS with NuxtJS as the front-end. \n\nConclusion: It's probably the best headless #CMS editor experience I have seen. The set-up had some hiccups however.\n\nDisclaimer: For this video my opinions are honest and real time. This is truly the first time I tried Storyblok.\n\nStoryblok:\nhttps://www.storyblok.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/storyblok\n\nFollow me here:\nhttps://timbenniks.dev\nhttps://twitter.com/timbenniks\nhttps://github.com/timbenniks"
