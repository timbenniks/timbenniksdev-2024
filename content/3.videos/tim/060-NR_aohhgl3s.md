title: "Interview with Evan You"
description: "I had the privilege to interview Evan You, the creator of Vue.js. I collaborated with Passionate People, the organizers of the excellent Vue.js Global conference and together we came up with a round table discussion format.\n\nIn this discussion I was joined by Marc Backes and Israel Rold치n Le칩n. We tend to go into the more personal and behind the scenes questions rather than just being technical. This provides a great look into Evan as a person rather than just talking tech.\n\nEvan You: https://twitter.com/youyuxi\nMarc Backes: https://twitter.com/themarcba\nIsrael Rold치n Le칩n: https://twitter.com/isro_me\nPassionate People: https://twitter.com/passionpeopleNL\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.dev\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks\n\nPoster image taken from Github.\n\n#vue #evanyou #interview"
