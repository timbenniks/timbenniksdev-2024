title: An Introduction to my YouTube Channel
description: |-
  Hi I'm Tim and welcome to my channel. This channel has content about web development. I do guides and in-depth pieces about development topics but I also interview prominent members of our community. 

  I interview people that are amazing at their job in the tech industry. I try to find the tools and best practices they use to shine on conference stages, contribute to open source projects or when they deliver high quality work.

  If you like this sort of stuff, subscribe! I'll see you in the comments.

  A little bit about me:
  Tim is a web developer from Amsterdam who moved to Paris to explore the magical world of luxury clients and baguettes. He likes to build fancy websites, make music and cook food.
