title: "Tim Tries Nuxt 3 & Algolia with Jakub Andrzejewski"
description: "Sometimes I try out tech or web services for the first time. I give feedback as I go, in real-time. This is the #TimTries Series. In this episode, I try out the Algolia #Nuxt3 module made by Jakub Andrzejewski.\n\nConclusion: Being a release candidate, Nuxt 3 is surprisingly stable, however, the ecosystem around it is not fully there yet. With some hiccups along the way, this Nuxt 3 module makes Algolia work great and super easy to use!\n\nDisclaimer: For this video my opinions are honest and real time. This is truly the first time I tried the Algolia module for Nuxt 3.\n\nJakub Andrzejewski:\nhttps://twitter.com/jacobandrewsky\n\nAlgolia module for Nuxt 3:\nhttps://algolia.nuxtjs.org\n\nFollow me here:\nhttps://timbenniks.dev\nhttps://twitter.com/timbenniks\nhttps://github.com/timbenniks"
