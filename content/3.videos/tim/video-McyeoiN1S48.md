title: "Tim's Vlog: How to be a successful leader"
description: "This is my second #vlog! Itâ€™s soft skill time again. I discuss the qualities successful leaders should posses to make a teams a success in a complex situation.\n\nDo take note: a leader is not always the manager. It could very well be that one of the more junior people take the leadership role. Managers you \"have\" to listen to. Leaders you \"want\" to listen to. \n\nBy a complex situation I mean a high pressure project with a big scope and not enough time, and on top the client is immature and is always upset. If you manage to get your team to be happy in these circumstances you will get a high quality result. \n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.dev/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks\n\n#leadership"
