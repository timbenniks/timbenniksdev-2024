transcript: hi my name is tim benicks and i create content for a living and i do this on my youtube channel but i also do it for work as a developer advocate and i speak at conferences and if they are virtual i like to pre-record them and because i do it so often i kind of just want to have the least amount of barrier to actually get going and create this content so like my camera is just always set up here it has the good settings and there's a light here and everything is in place so i just hit a button and run and so i didn't want my gear to be too expensive and too fitly with too many options because i would just lose myself in a gear trap however things do need to be great i love it when things look good and so in this video i will show you that i just bought a new light because i know lights make things so much better and i never really went into like okay what do i need how strong does it need to be how does the diffuser look do i need a soft box all of that and i just went for it took the plunge and i bought a godox sl60w and to be fair i knew it wasn't the best light out there but for the price it was great so i got the box and it was a little flimsy and it felt like maybe it was a used unit because it didn't even have the plug socket i need for my kind of power outlets and so there was a converter in it and you know what for the price still good but it's super loud the fan noise was huge it's insane and so i could probably get away with it because this mic doesn't pick up too much noise but actually having to do endless meetings and live streams and things like that and having a fan on your face the whole time it's not great and so i also actually got a really nice stand and i got a good softbox and so already it looks great even with this godox light but um normally i do lots of research and i just i buy the thing and i know okay this is it but then i was complaining a bit to my wife it's like hey i spent this amount of money and it's making so much noise and she's like why don't you just exchange it pay a bit more for something else don't stick to what you chose and just be flexible and i thought you know what i'm just gonna just google again and see okay what's one step up that's actually a bit better but not too much more expensive and with that came the aperture amaran 100x and that's a relatively new light in their lineup and before this time i wasn't able to actually get it anywhere here in europe and i stopped looking and then i forgot about it and i bought this godox light that i didn't like as much and then i looked on the internet and there it was and it's only a hundred bucks more expensive or a little bit more like 110 and oh boy this thing is awesome like the unboxing experience alone is so much better and it's a smaller light it has a higher wattage output it's completely silent and yeah i'm just really happy that i just got something that's only a little bit more expensive but it helps me so much more because i can leave this thing on and just work and not worry about it and i can use a little app to just turn it on and change things and yes convenience really helps so if you are looking for a light as well i would suggest look at all the options of course look at your budget but if you can save just a little more go with one of these aperture lights and don't go with one cheaper and i know if you don't have the funds disregard this but if you have or you can save up a bit longer go for the one up of the lowest in the tier that you need i did this with my camera i did this with my lens i now did it with my light i did it with my computer and you know what i've been making content for a living and it all looks decent and it worked really well so that was a short video of my experience with buying a light and exchanging it and hopefully this advice helped you a little bit see you next time
