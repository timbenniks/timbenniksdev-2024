title: "An Interview with Ishan Anand (CTO) and Mark Brocado (VP of Engineering) from Moovweb"
description: "In this video I interview Ishan Anand (co-founder/CTO) and Mark Brocado (VP of Engineering) from Moovweb. Moovweb is an all-in-one JAMstack platform to develop, deploy, preview, split test and monitor your frontend. The cool thing is that Moovweb is able to combine dynamic routing with static serving on the CDN edge. \n\nI'm intrigued by this concept and I wonder why Netlify and Vercel are not doing similar things. Ishan and Mark go deep and explain everything!\n\nFind Ishan, Mark and Moovweb here:\nhttps://moovweb.com\nhttps://twitter.com/moovweb\n\nFollow me here:\nhttps://timbenniks.dev/\nhttps://twitter.com/timbenniks\nhttps://buymeacoff.ee/timbenniks"
