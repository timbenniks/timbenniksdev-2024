transcript: "so AI is huge right now we all know this this is an open door but I still found some stuff that I know I'm a bit late to the game but it's so so good because I'm looking as a death row slash content creator to tools that AI can give me to go faster to creativity less fiddling around but also less post-processing and so I found this thing by Adobe called Adobe podcasts and they have a few free things like checking your mic if it's good enough and what you have to do to fix it but also artificially enhance whatever audio you give it and give it back something completely different and so let's go into my video editor because I'm gonna show you so essentially when I record I generally just have the audio from this camera it's just as reference right and it's it's not great and it's a little echoey but it's it's just as reference so I have it and then I have this sure sm7b which is really an excellent mic and it doesn't pick up all the surroundings anyways what if I didn't have this and only the camera reference what if AI could make that awesome so I'm gonna show you the audio that comes out of this and then after that I'll show you the reference and whatever came out of adobe's system so here we go listen a bit and so I have recently started to use the so here that's pretty echoing crappy right let's and then so I just outputted the audio to a file uploaded it to Adobe and then I came back and this is what they gave me TNT stack which is Tailwind next GS and typescript isn't that ridiculously good of course it sounds a little dry to me and it's a little like um podcasties like little boomi but it's just opinion and imagine this is the first version imagine what happens in a year how good this will get and so let's now listen to the actual sm7b reference mic or typescript next in Tailwind one of those it's TNT and it's quite new so you can hear there's a bit more live in the real mic but it's negligible and so I'll just go over all three again and just be amazed what this free tool gave me okay let's go back to the Rock on camera in the term but actually it's kind of to me it felt quite natural because I don't like see this is the enhanced one by other oh that fancy Emoji related stuff personally because I've just not used it so much more of this is just your sm7b of an old-school CSS guy and then Tailwind just sneaked in one day so what if this next iteration of adobe gets just slightly better you don't need to buy like a 400 mic and a huge audio interface and all the stuff you just use what you have run around and have awesome content anyways A revolution is happening and I just wanted to share with you cheers"
