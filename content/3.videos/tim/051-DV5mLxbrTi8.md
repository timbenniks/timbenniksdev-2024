But that slows down your website!\n\nI found a way to remove Google Analytics JavaScript but still provide data to its back-end. I even added web vitals! I did all of it in Nuxt!\n\nCredit: https://twitter.com/DasSurma\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.dev/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks"
