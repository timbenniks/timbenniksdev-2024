title: "An Interview with Una Verhoeven Global Sitecore Architect at Valtech"
description: "In this video I'm interviewing Una Verhoeven. Una and I work together at Valtech. When she joined the global team as a Sitecore Architect we teamed up to help out on a challenging project. We became fast friends and when I learnt about her story I decided an interview had to take place. Some people just impress. Una is one of those.\n\nWe talk about switching cultures from Serbia to the Netherlands, starting your own company and fashion.\n\nIn this video series I interview people that are amazing at their jobs in the tech industry. I try to find out what makes these people shine - how to they deliver such high quality work? What tools and best practices do they recommend?\n\nFollow Una here:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/unaverhoeven\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.nl/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks\n\n#sitecore #interview #valtech"
