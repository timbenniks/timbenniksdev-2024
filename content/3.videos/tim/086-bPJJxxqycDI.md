title: "Tim Tries: Slice Machine by Nuxt and Prismic"
description: "I sometimes just try out new tech or web services for the first time and give my feedback as I go. In this video I look at Slice Machine, a #Vuejs component library connected to the #Prismic headless CMS. This service is a collaboration between the Prismic and #Nuxtjs. \n\nConclusion: Solid base. Needs some fine tuning.\nDisclaimer: this content is not sponsored and my opinions are honest and real time.\n\nhttps://www.slicemachine.dev/\nhttps://vue-essential-slices.netlify.app/\nhttps://prismic.io/\nhttps://nuxtjs.org/\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.nl/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks\n\n#timtries"
