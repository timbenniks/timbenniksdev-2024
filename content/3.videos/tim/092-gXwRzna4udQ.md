description: "During #COVID19 pandemic I decided to do more with music. In this series called \"Quarantine Licks\" I will show you fun and juicy guitar licks every week.\n\nFor now I kept them acoustic but expect electric guitar also. Rock 'n roll will commence :)\n\nI'm open for collaborations. Comment on this video if you're keen.\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.nl/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\n\n#guitarlicks #quarantinelicks"
