title: "Lazy Loading Images with Prismic and Vue.js"
description: "In this video I explain how I managed to add lazy loading images in Vue.js while getting image data from the headless CMS Prismic. \n\nIn this case itâ€™s not just a matter of creating a Vue component as I also get images rendered in HTML from the Prismic Rich text field. \n\nThis is a lazy loading solution for images that works both in vanilla JS and Vue. \n\nSee it in action here: http://timbenniks.nl\nFind the code here: https://github.com/timbenniks/timbenniks2020\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.nl/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks\n\n#vuejs #prismic #lazyloading"
