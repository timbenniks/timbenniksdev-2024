title: "Tim Tries: Figma, Zeplin and Storybook. Mind is blown..."
description: "I sometimes just try out new tech or web services for the first time and give my feedback as I go. This is the #timtries Series. In this video I look at Figma, Zeplin and Storybook. I recently learnt how nicely all these tools integrate so developers get a MUCH better DX. Zeplin acts as the hub and the creative source of truth for development, QA, business analysts, UX and creative people.\n\nConclusion: Mind is blown... Zeplin CLI is amazing.\nDisclaimer: this content is not sponsored and my opinions are honest and real time.\n\nFollow me here:\nBuy me a coffee: https://www.buymeacoff.ee/timbenniks\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.dev/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks"

transcript: "what is up welcome back to yet another tim tries so in this video series i try out stuff that i never did before so i genuinely look at something the first time so this time i'm going to look into how to make sure that your design system for your project really connect to your technology and so a couple of weeks ago i saw my colleague brian from new york give this demo on how to connect the creative work to the interactive style guide and to your code editor and my mind was blown and i always wanted to use this but i never really saw it in practice it was really hard to do and now that the technology advanced a little bit i'm more senior i kind of know what i want now i thought okay it's time i'm just gonna try this so after the intro we'll dive in what you can do with figma zepplin storybook and vs go there we go [Music] all right so here in my browser i just loaded a little image that i just photoshopped together and here you'll see we have figma zeppelin and storybook so basically let me just go over what i think those are figma is kind of the new photoshop the new sketch but then online it's all in a browser it's really good it's really good for web development it's really good for making designs that are modular with components and reusable stuff and responsive stuff great stuff right so then we have zeppelin and zeppelin is similar to projects like envision where you can kind of look at your designs online and they're all synced there so photoshop can sing their sketch can sing their figma can sync there probably more and then you can actually look at all the screens and you can inspect so when you click on a button you can actually see the code or you can see whatever it's really cool so it also has like a style guide and you can see reusable components in it so zeppelin is kind of your source of truth for your design for everybody in your team and then we have storybook which is basically what sapling is but then with actual front-end code so here this which we call our living style guide so apparently what my colleague showed me you can connect all of them up so figma and zeppelin have a native connection there's like a plugin you can use so when you design something you can sync it with zeppelin so then web developers would go to zeppelin and actually have a look at that design but wouldn't it be cool if those designs were directly also matched with your storybook work where you put your real code and wouldn't it be cool if i could also link to let's say confluence or a wiki or a ticketing system or my github or my fiest code all from zeppelin so this becomes like the hub and this is possible so today i'm gonna try that so when you have a look here you actually have this connected components from zeppelin so this came out somewhere last year you see six months ago so this is pretty new and actually when you go over it you can see here in zeppelin you have some really cool side panel that actually shows me like this i guess this is a react button right and it has an opening github open in storybook i want this stuff so i already did a bit of homework because i didn't want you to look at me creating projects and designs and setting up everything so i have a storybook running with one button inside i already built it so how about we go to figma create a button and then sync that to zeppelin and then connect zeppelin to my vs code and how everything connects basically let's let's go for that so first let's open figma so this is very simple we're just going to make like a really simple button okay i'm going to make it black and then inside i'm going to write something and that's going to have to be white and let's maybe center it nicely okay i'm just literally gonna use it like this well this is a bit big maybe can we change the font size um you know what let's not go there what you can do though is actually connect this and make this a component so this is what i've learned so now that i created a component out of this we can actually look at the assets and then here we have local components so this thing you can reuse everywhere in your design so for now i'm not going to dive in and do more this is literally it we don't need more from figma so what i've seen um i already connected a zeppelin two figma so we can actually go plugins zeppelin let's see what it does so it's loading my zeppelin so now i have to select what i want to sync and i want to do export so now it's launching my zeppelin local app okay and so i have an amazing um web design thing already so you can see here this is also amazing web design i just made two projects so i'm gonna be like okay let's just export let's run with it okay so now it opens zeppelin imported component one so i think this is going to be in the style guide components yes i think yes so now what we did when i click on this i can actually click on this and inspect it and it actually says i am a button this is my class name and it has like width and height and font family and stuff like that i can go into all the specifics that i need and this is also not a zeppelin video so i'm not going to dive deeper into that but this basically has a local style light where i have a button that is going to be able to be reused but then look here on the side connect this component to your components in code and see quick links and stuff like that so that's what we're going for so basically this will be the heart this page here or maybe color palette or dashboard or whatever but let's say our style guide is the heart of our project and i want to be able to link to everywhere from here right so turns out there is a video oh not video a vs code plugin for vs code that connects zeppelin and then in there you can actually do a whole bunch so let's install that oh before we go um why not i'll show you um the button that i built in storybook mdm run story book okay running running running so now it's basically just opening storybook and there's my button so this i pre-built this is just a vgs button very simple you have some props and on click action there's nothing else or you can look at the docs and you can see like i did nothing else to this there's no different variations of the button nothing else it's just the same as in figma basically right and i've also already created a git repository because i want to later on connect git to my zeppelin okay so now let's go to vs code and find this zeppelin plugin okay so zepplin this is this thing the thing we're just looking at so okay so let's install reload okay we just got a little icon here okay this is my design project so um i'm guilty here because a couple of weeks ago my colleague brian that showed me this say hey you just installed that vs code plugin and so i'm already logged in to my my zeppelin that doesn't mean that i know what i'm doing but that just i thought when i uninstalled it and reinstalled it for the video i would have to log in but it's smart nice it's still there so basically this is my amazing design screens and components which is basically this is also the my amazing design project there we go and this is the cell guide with components so let's have a look and then we can see components here component one um let's just open it up oh and it just opened from field code into this that is pretty decent that's a nice start right but i know and i've seen you can actually connect all of this code that we see here my um my story file here you can connect this also to zeppelin and there is a documentation here so we looked at this before right so basically getting started so we are using fjs in this case so let's just open this tab and try to install it okay so um yeah so they're talking about this configuration file and i've seen that before so let's go to vs code and actually try to just type zeppelin here create zeppelin configuration file so okay i've seen brian do this so basically this is the components.json that connects everything together and i think what you can even do because there's a zeppelin cli that i've also previously installed you can actually when you hit zeppelin connect you can connect this file to the files in your code base right to zeppelin so there's like an api connection so let's add a project so i am in my personal workspace and you can see all my projects here so in my amazing design project i don't think we have a style guide but we do have components and then actually now it finds oh yeah this is my local button.view yeah that's my component ok and now so it's found a component with the path to my button and then we can connect that to a zeppelin component which is my component one okay so now i saved it and eslint or prettier did something to it but basically it now created it knows the project and it knows my components now um i think however we can do more here because what i saw when we go back to that fuji s thing is that this oh yeah so prepare the configuration file we just did that um yeah we did all of this add components from your code base we did and then isn't there like okay so this is zeppelin names yeah so the cli thing i did that before and then we have to install the plug-in okay this we can do and we have to turn off this and install this while we wait let's read a bit more okay so we just have to add that plug-in to the configuration okay let's do it okay so now it has the zeppelin cli connect plug-in view and then what they're saying oh here we go run the zeppelin cli so with the sapling connect so this is the thing i tried before so i'm just gonna go and click that now so i think what it did now is it basically looked at that connection thing that components are json and connected it to zeppelin so let's open zaplin click on that button and now we can see there's this my button thing so this is basically an instance of my code and it says to because it probably read my props so it knows this is a string and that that's pretty decent so it kind of okay so it's in storage button.view so when i click this i want to go to visual studio code and open the magic this is actually my component it's a pity that it didn't open it in my open project already but you know it's nice let's get back because i think okay so this we did let me see this is the fuji s one right because i saw here look we can add repository links but also storybook links i think that's what we want to do first so let's open storybook and have a look okay so we're going to have to install that plugin also to be honest it's a pity that it's global installs i don't really like that again you know whatever i prefer that it's local so i don't pollute my global scope or whatever okay so it installed that it's really fast that's nice um so then i'm gonna have to add my plug-in okay we can do this so another plug-in and they look at localhost 9009 but my thing i think it ran at 606 right yeah okay let's see um what else because just with this i don't think that's gonna be enough oh we can also have a remote instance okay so when i um output my storybook maybe to whatever versal or netlify we can link there that's pretty cool okay so the component stuff we did this yes we did that too ah but look there's actually a storybook property okay let's add this to our zeppelin names actually i don't like this component one but i never gave it a nice name in oh look whoa it actually has like a nice view of it imagine if this was like a proper component that looks cool so it is a design system button but let's just call it component one because well that's actually what it is right and it has different stories so i know i made one story right when we look at my stories i just have the primary the default one or when you look it's as hilly as okay so let's call it primary then that's the only one that i have let's see do we need to do more i don't think so i think we just aye we sappling connect again well we can do that let's connect it ah detective storybook at 6006 nice so it's found the story okay oh yeah opening storybook yeah that's cool so now we can actually go from in this place we can now go to storybook we can go to visual studio code and we can see our component here but i know there's more i know we can also have links to github and we can have links to let's say your wiki and stuff like that so let's have a look so here repository links i think that's what we want let's have a look i think this is probably not even a plug-in they probably just understand it already um ah so we can literally just say okay oh that's my mistake github okay let's put that in i said where did i want it below components and of course this is timpanics and i made it called i called it this one would that that's it wait let's read i never read i should read ah because probably it knows this path so i i'm assuming it's just gonna work ah branch yeah i actually have master oops it's json not javascript okay let's zaplin connect again and see what it added for us okay okay there's the github let's click beam there's my source stories button.view what i like this so much man and it's you know what this is also it's so simple i want to know if there's more now okay we did this one custom links and then we have style guidelines i don't use that so probably not so but let's have a look what the custom links do oh i can literally choose what it is okay i can have a links property and then say confluence and then have a url okay well i won't do that now because i don't have a confluence page but potentially that's pretty cool oh and then you can add a confluence property with the url path okay so the link here for type confluence it's like the base url and then you add the url path it's basically like the path of your code with the github one yeah okay that kind of makes sense so with this we can open it in confluence we can open it in jira maybe we have some other systems maybe we can you know i'm liking it um is there anything else we should dive into i don't think so i'm already talking for 18 minutes so let's like this is awesome right now my zeppelin and imagine this was a rich experience right with a lot of content imagine how easy it is for a developer to actually have a look and say okay this is my my thing this is the props i need let's open it in github or in storybook let's open in storybook let's see if my code is actually the same right i can put that side by side and actually have a look and i can see now my padding is probably a little bit off but what's interesting to me is we also have figma and maybe what i want to do is this oh red doesn't work okay okay and then we're just gonna sync this okay export complete i don't think i did that right you know what screw it doesn't matter um i did too much anyways thank you for watching and i'll see you next time"
