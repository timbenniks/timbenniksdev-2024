title: "I fell back in love with Sitecore"
description: "Sitecore has been career-defining for me, we lost touch for a while, but recently, we fell back in love...\n\n#Sitecore is an excellent CMS but with a few flaws due to its monolithic nature and, more recently, due to its pseudo-composable approach. I found a way to love Sitecore again by decoupling its content management and front-end rendering parts. You can use @UniformVisualWorkspace to select content from a Sitecore instance and funnel it into any front end you desire. \n\nThis approach gives you developer freedom, a way to add any other headless source without worry, and you can host anywhere you want. Say goodbye to your slow and expensive CD servers! \n\nIn this video, I use Nuxt 3 for the rendering - because why not!?\n\nFind out more about #Uniform at https://uniform.dev\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.dev\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks"
