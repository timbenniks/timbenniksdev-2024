title: Tim Benniks - Automate all the things. AI, Nuxt, Countentstack, Clouidinary, and more.

description: |-
  In this talk, Tim explains how a joke experiment recording developer videos on a Ring doorbell turned into a serious exploration of low-effort, high-impact content, and how making something feel authentic and messy is often far more complex than polished marketing. He walks through why traditional SEO-driven, high-production dev content no longer resonates, and shows how he built a fully automated, AI-powered video pipeline using Contentstack for orchestration and content modeling, ElevenLabs for voice cloning, HeyGen for video generation, Cloudinary for compositing and delivery, and Nuxt UI for the frontend. The result is a composable system where scripts, voices, avatars, background noise, and visual effects are stitched together with minimal code, letting him generate and publish “doorbell videos” from anywhere, even a plane, while staying focused on real value for developers rather than algorithms or polish.
