title: The rant-to-blogpost pipeline with AI
description: |-
  My way of creating content is through ranting. I prefer monologue over the written form.
  I finally found a way to create written content through my preferred method: speaking. 
  This is the first use of AI I personally find useful.

  Try https://blogrecorder.com, it's fantastic.

transcript: what I need is a rant to block post Pipeline and I need to make sure that this works in a way that I can just literally rant like this do something that then makes me a blog post because I've tried you know writing things down outlining it it takes me hours I'm just it's also not my native language in English I have to ask an Editor to help me and it's always kind of it works but it's not great so I'm about to show you something magical because I actually just got my rant to blog post Pipeline and it's working and it's actually happening right here so my friend Eddie think created Block recorder.com in his spare time and I'm just recording this right now as my personal rant to this thing so um let's go into the browser and see what this just did to me so here there's my temporary title until post is processed so you can see I already have two other blog post that I just spoke into my phone and so this is still processing so let's kind of just wait give it a second and I'll just fast forward this thing and then we'll see what happens a few moments later there it is The Accidental Genius of Rand driven development I didn't come up with that title blog recorder did so let's have a look what is actually looks like what did it make for me and so look at this so I just got an editor so so I kind of just rambled and ranted my intro into this system blog recorder.com and it just gave me here The Accidental Genius of rent driven Development I've always found that my best ideas come from sitting down with the intention to brainstorm oh don't come exactly so it is in the midst of a run blah blah blah here the struggle of crafting content experimenting with AI assistance it's it's you know know this writing is actually it's decent but it just got me started right discover the magic of blog recorder seeing is believing well how about that this is like a minute and a half of intro there is my blog post and so what I would normally now do is kind of remove some of the obvious things that give this away as something AI did right all that stuff is not really cool but that's a small thing to fix and I tend to just have a real needed this and of and you can see actually my grammarly is kind of stepping in here and says hey maybe you want to write this slightly differently because blog recorder is very new I haven't been able to say hey write it like this or learn who I am you know it we haven't fed this back to the model but this is really just it's covering everything I just said so what I would do now is I would just rewrite some of the paragraphs add a little bit of detail here and there if needed and then basically copy the markdown and go or copy the HTML and this is really pretty great and it works super well so this is just a short video showing my Rand to blog post Pipeline and I'm super excited about it you all should try out blog recorder.com if this is your way of creating content do you Rand do you then have to just monologue it out and it's hard for you to write this is it all right happy writing cheers
