description: |-
  During #COVID19 pandemic I decided to do more with music. In this series called "Quarantine Licks" I will show you fun and juicy guitar licks every week.

  For now I kept them acoustic but expect electric guitar also. Rock 'n roll will commence :)

  I'm open for collaborations. Comment on this video if you're keen.
