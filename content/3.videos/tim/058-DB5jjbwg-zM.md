title: "Interview with Alex Shyba co-founder of Uniform"
description: "In this video I interview Alex Shyba, co-founder of Uniform. At work (I'm web development director at a big agency), Alex did some consulting for us and we were always impressed by his skills and excellent manners. In this interview we dive into what Uniform does, why he started it and he even shows us how it works.\n\nEnterprise software vendors better watch out. This startup will disrupt. I would pay close attention to their roadmap in the coming months. Expect a Tim Tries video when their software reaches open beta.\n\nAbout Uniform:\nUniform enables jamstack with your current Enterprise Digital Experience Platform and unlocks edge-based personalization with the tools you already have.\n\nFind Alex and Uniform here:\nhttps://twitter.com/alexshyba\nhttps://twitter.com/UniformDev\nhttps://uniform.dev/\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.dev/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks"
