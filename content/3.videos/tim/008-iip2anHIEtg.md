title: "HeyGen AI: Transform Your Sales Productivity with Personalized Video Outreach"
description: "In this video, I'll show you how to revolutionize your sales outreach game using personalized videos, made possible by using HeyGen's API.\n\nGone are the days of generic cold emails and phone calls. With HeyGen, Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) can now scale up their outreach efforts like never before. Imagine sending out dozens, even hundreds of personalized videos to your prospects, all with just a few clicks.\n\nIn this video, I break down the key benefits of incorporating personalized videos into your sales outreach strategy. You'll discover how HeyGen AI enables SDRs to add personalized data into the video scripts, making each outreach feel tailor-made for the recipient. I created a proof of concept app to show how you can do this.\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.dev\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks"

transcript: "in this video I'm going to blow your mind with what AI can do for your business and sales because what we know is that Outreach works really well when you do video and it works even better when you personalize that video but we all know making video is hard you need equipment it's a lot of time it's hard to do to speak well on camera it's a very different thing than just selling on Zoom or sending emails right and so I created a landing page that integrates with your CRM like HubSpot or Salesforce something like that and then you take your prospect data and then what you can do is with AI you can render a personalized video with a script that you choose either you get that script from your prospecting system because it's some funnel email or you write it yourself I am really excited about what you can do with AI so I'll let's go to the browser I'm going to show you all right so we're in the browser now and I do apologize that my little camera icon on the left overlaps a little bit on the website but what I've built here Empower your sdrs with the magic of AI and so you can actually create personalized Outreach video with your avatar and your voice or a translated Voice or whatever you want so what you can do you can select HubSpot in this case so I've logged into HubSpot here and this is a very simplified view of whatever my Prospect data is so let's select Nicholas and we met at a storytelling lunch where we were all talking about the best experiences website can give you personalization all that stuff and his company is Chanel and so now I've also logged in with hey gen that you that's my AI ephratar render system and I can select a bunch of different avatars you can hear actually this is Josh the CEO of agen but let's select me imagine that this could also be your CEO or this could be some thought leader that a lot of people know right you can use different people's AI of course with consent it's very important um there's a ton of different voices here that select my own but if you wrote your script in French you could select a French voice and it would be perfect and so then you can actually see hey there's my script and I know again my apologies my camera is a little bit over maybe I can show it to you can I go a bit like this here you go hey Nicholas we met at the storytelling lunch and I have a fix for Chanel all that stuff so it's completely personalized and so you can see there's a create video button here so I'm just gonna hit create video and so this generally takes a second in hey gen and so while we wait let me talk to you about this because normally what you want if this this is a proof of concept that I made now right it's just a test just to see what I can do with AI and generation and stuff like that but imagine this is actually integrated into salesforter or HubSpot that you don't have to do all this it's all like super easy and it sends the email just think about the possibilities right okay so let's go to Hayden and refresh and now you can see there is my video so this was just generated of course when this is a finished product you will see this in your prospecting tool and you can just send it out it will all be automated for now it's just this so when I hit play you will see um a little bit of an overlay because this is a test API key here we go are you ready this is going to be fun hi Nicholas I came across your name at the storytelling lunch and was wondering if you could help me out I have a solution for easily transitioning to a headless CMS that I think Chanel could really benefit from but I'm having trouble connecting who is the right person to discuss this opportunity with and how may I reach them I appreciate your time how incredible is that imagine this doesn't have the overlay and it literally just looks like me talking to them um let me show you another one I actually created a video with Joshua my friend the hey gen CEO with the same script but with a slightly Americanized voice that he normally doesn't have here you go hi Nicholas I came across your name at the storytelling lunch and was wondering if you could help me out I have a solution for easily transitioning to a headless CMS that I think should how incredibly mind-blowing is this it is such high quality and imagine sending these videos personalizing to the people and then do that 100 times a day the the conversion you're gonna get is so high and then think about translating it into different languages this is just mind-blowing use of AI technology this is something you can use pretty soon like I know Hayden is working on sales related things for if you work in a sales team and doing these type of automations I just use their backend apis and because I'm a developer right so I try to do it and show them anyways my mind is blown I'm going to be pitching this to my friends who work in sales teams to see if we can actually build this thing for real anyways happy selling happy coding happy AI anyways cheers bye"
