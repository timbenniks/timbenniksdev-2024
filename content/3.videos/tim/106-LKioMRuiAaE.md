title: "An interview with Eduardo from the Vue.js core team"
description: "In this video I'm interviewing Eduardo San Martin Morote from the Vue.js core team. What a privilege to speak to someone who actually built the tools I use on a daily basis! Eduardo humbly explains how he sees life and how he acts as a contributor to open source projects.\n\nWhat a guy. I'm in awe how Eduardo carries himself and what this youngster has already accomplished.\n\nIn this video series I interview people that are amazing at their job in the tech industry. I try to find the tools and best practices they use to shine on conference stages, contribute to open source projects or when they deliver high quality work.\n\nFollow Eduardo here:\nhttps://twitter.com/posva\nhttps://github.com/sponsors/posva\nhttps://esm.dev/\nhttps://twitter.com/posva/status/1146415898967908352\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.nl/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks"
