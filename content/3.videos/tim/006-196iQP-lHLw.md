transcript: "developer relations is all about the impact on the success of the developers in your product let's talk about developer relations in 2024 because last year was pretty rough for lots of startups there's this pendulum swing of money is cheap Investments go fast versus actually make make things work now because money is tight all those things happen and you know what developer relations teams are generally the first ones who um get the boot in this kind of situations because developer relations is really wide ranging it's really hard for the folks um who are looking at the business of what is success and what is not success to figure out this is what a death R does this is where they stay and these are their goals and so I I want to talk about what you can do as a death RA in 2024 to make this successful and so in the end when you think about it um developer relations is all about the impact on the success of the developers in your product where once they're in you actually take care of those developers right you figure out what do they need to be more successful and so in the end developer relations teams need to show the impact that they have of course on developer success but that goes into revenue revenue is the word make sure as a developer relations team that you have all these touch points on where is the revenue made when a developer enters the whole cycle right if it's just about the signups to get people in some of them will on their own figure things out and buy but that is not actually touching the revenue as much it's just touching the growth and showing the potential but where the real revenue is is actually when these developers start to become successful inside they're taken care of by developer relations teams and they start to you know Inspire their bosses to buy it starts to actually be very interesting when you think about um customer success teams and enablement teams and partner teams inside startups developer relations people can make the content and the programs and the learning parts and all of that for all these um departments and then suddenly the developer relations team actually adds to how we get recurring revenue from customer success or how we get new revenue from partner product L growth with let's say agencies that love your CMS use it and then actually you know buy more and more for their customers and so it's all about how do we make sure developers are more successful and then we measure all these points and then you show your worth and so it's a true impact on the success of developers you make them faster towards goals and growth because that's what we want to actually measure the success of people staying in that's where the money will be made later on right so measure from sign up to First API usage or sign up to creating a schema in a database let's say for a CMS that is then extended and used or things like that like like activation how many projects does a person start after being signed up how many things how many projects are actually used live where the API endpoint is actually used like there's lots of these measurements like is somebody still active after 7 Days of signing up like there's a ton of those tiny metrics that are really interesting to see because the more you know about that the more you can attribute the developers use cases and whatever they do to developer relations work cuz if you make amazing starters where you have a setup of your product and a front-end code for example that accelerates that usage immediately right and then you set them up for success to do more things later um I think I got by point across it's a hard time for developer relations folks and so play the game understand the disciplines and figure out how you can impact developer success and therefore show Revenue you know in a POS positive way anyways that's it um Good Luck um [Music] cheers"
