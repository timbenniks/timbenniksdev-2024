title: "A developers guide to low carbon websites"
description: "This is my ImageCon 2020 talk.\n\nHow to make more sustainable choices in the production of web technology. This talk helps developers to make changes to their code so that their website has a lower carbon footprint.\n\nIf the internet was a country, it would be the world’s sixth biggest polluter. The internet consumes a lot of electricity. 466TWh per year to be precise. That’s more than the entire United Kingdom (300TWh)! \n\nCarbon emissions are generated all over the place, from data centers to our personal devices. The average website produces 1.76 grams CO2 per page view. For a website with 10,000 monthly page views, that's 211 kg CO2 per year. These are staggering numbers and they will only go up as the internet is growing at a frightening rate. To make the internet more sustainable, web developers have three areas of attention.\n\n1. Design and content\n2. Front-end development best practices\n3. Server architecture choices"
