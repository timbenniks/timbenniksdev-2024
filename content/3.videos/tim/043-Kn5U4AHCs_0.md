  I had the privilege to speak at DevBreak21: The Ultimate Tech Festival. It's indeed more of a festival than a conference. Held in an ancient castle, the grounds allowed for lot's of activities and multiple talk tracks. 

  I had a great time!

transcript: tomorrow i'm speaking at death break an in-person conference a bit south of paris in an old castle it's gonna be amazing so i'll take you on my trip there and show you everything that's cool about it let's go [Music] i am in the car ready to rock our own car actually broke recently um mysteriously no less and our insurance actually gave us this car as a rental for a couple of days to kind of bridge the gap of not having a car which is really decent um so seven hours to the conference on we go so i just parked just to have a little break it's such a terrible place i didn't even want to eat my food here so i'll just go back in the car and eat it there like a poor salt oh boy it seems my fork has been submerged lovely i wanted to talk about the fact that this is the first trip i'm taking that's a little bit longer than let's say 100 kilometers in two years right other than moving house this is the first trip i'm taking to actually do something other than what is needed in life and we've been super careful with corona because my wife she's in the risk group so if she gets corona it's bad news and so she was also one of the first people in france to get vaccinated you know with all the elderly people and people at risk so that's great but still i'm going to a conference that is in person and i'm kind of worried right i'm going to be i brought like a lot of masks i'm taking safety precautions but still i could never forgive myself if i get corona and not get too sick right but then give it to my wife who would then go to the hospital that would be terrible so i'm being conscious contemplating this stuff while i eat but still wanting to go out and you know talk at a conference about my passion and my job and you know life is a balance so i better be careful and um yeah i'll go let's just dig into some food and back on the road so that was a pretty long drive but you know i'm feeling quite good um so i'll socialize a little with the other speakers i saw that some of them already arrived um that's more private so i won't put them on the flock that's not cool unless they want to of course so i just arrived and this is a really nice it's like a little cottage that you have for yourself and then all the speakers actually have their own and it's like on this really big land and there's like a big mansion there that they did up and to to actually make into like a hotel or jeets that's what they call it here in france it's really cool free speakers dinner this is just insane [Music] so [Music] i just woke up and i'm a little groggy it's a bit of a short night but what a speaker's dinner that was well i cannot open my eyes i'm still asleep and my talk is at three today so i have some time to wake up anyways i was at the table with an astronaut with someone who worked at the w3c for like 25 years who came up with svg i spoke to the guy who created the vlc video player which is like a player that's on like 90 of computers in the world and he does it for free like what a lineup wow i can only say this was just ridiculous i kind of need to wake up and look for coffee [Music] holy this doesn't look half bad [Music] [Music] this famous image known as earthrise is probably the most influential photograph ever taken you know up for the upcoming talks we have this afternoon uh we've got some exciting talks and also the party this evening so all right so i'm on my way to my talk it's in the tent right over there and here it's really nice and breezy but the tent is like 45 degrees or maybe like 90 something or 100 something um freedom degrees if you're from the us anyways um getting ready it's actually so hot there are almost no people here that's gonna be a very intimate affair with my talk i'm on my way back from the conference and man it was great i had a really good time and of course because it was in person i got to speak to people well at a distance of course the conference did a great job with security about corona if you didn't have like your qr code um for vaccination or test result you were just refused flat out and all the inside bits people were masks that was awesome and so i actually made some new friends because in person you can kind of mingle a bit more it was really nice and when i got started you probably saw a bit before in the video um in the tent where i was speaking it was like really hot like 45 degrees or something and so it started out with only like five people attending my talk and those were the five people i met those were all speakers and then the cameraman and the crew that's it but luckily over time it's filled up and people really enjoyed the talk and so i did have a good time um during a talk but then at one moment um the photographer lady came really close up and she started taking proper pictures of me because they're publicizing everything to talk about right but i felt like sweat drip while that happened so there are going to be some intense pictures of me anyways um i'm on the way back now i just drove like three hours um i didn't sleep that much but that's part of the game at conferences i guess i didn't drink much because i knew i would be destroyed in the car i wanted to talk about why i spoke about the discussions because in this vlog you probably don't really notice what that was about and so i spoke about the modern way of building websites and of course that's a really wide subject and so i focused a little bit more on something called the digital experience platform which is like basically every website has a is a platform with multiple things right you have a front and you have a back end you have cms you have marketing stuff you have analytics whatever this is all part of this platform and traditionally these platforms they were built as like one big suite of one chunk of software on one big server on big origin that would actually build these websites and so you can imagine if one piece of software does all these things that a website needs most of those things are going to be mediocre except for one or two and so traditionally all the big websites have this system and it's starting to you know hold them back it's really hard to iterate over specific parts they want to change them or they want to have one part much better they have to like get another contract and go out of this big suite of software it's just challenging and so nowadays there's lots of companies that are much smaller in scope but really good at what they do and new digital experience platforms that are coming out as we speak they actually use all these services separately that are really good at what they do and they choose exactly what they need so you might need not need e-commerce if you just have a block right or whatever and so you just choose what you need but that also comes with its complexities because how do you orchestrate everything together how do you make sure it works together and it's easy for both content editors and nerds like me or other developers to actually make all that work and so that was what my talk was about to how um where i work at uniform how we deal with this and how do we make it much better and yeah that was kind of fun it sounds kind of dry when i say it like this but the talk was actually well received of course i put in a lot of memes good stuff anyways i just wanted to kind of go over what i spoke about but it will be on youtube so you you'll be able to see it anyways um i better drive on cheers
