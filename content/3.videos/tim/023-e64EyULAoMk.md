title: I fell back in love with Sitecore
description: |-
  Sitecore has been career-defining for me, we lost touch for a while, but recently, we fell back in love...

  #Sitecore is an excellent CMS but with a few flaws due to its monolithic nature and, more recently, due to its pseudo-composable approach. I found a way to love Sitecore again by decoupling its content management and front-end rendering parts. You can use @UniformVisualWorkspace to select content from a Sitecore instance and funnel it into any front end you desire. 

  This approach gives you developer freedom, a way to add any other headless source without worry, and you can host anywhere you want. Say goodbye to your slow and expensive CD servers! 

  In this video, I use Nuxt 3 for the rendering - because why not!?

transcript: what is up I am back for another video what if I told you you could use sidecore in a completely heartless way and still keep using it because your content editors are probably quite used to how Cycle Works your backend developers quite understand how the data models go and how the pipelines and all the awesome things keep that in place but as a frontender be able to work outside of experience editor make your own front and doesn't matter what kind of front that you put against it and also as a Content editor have the flexibility to quite easily just add let's say in algolia Search and a cloudinary image and whatever Shopify anything goes and sidecar just sits there as the content repository that you just take stuff from and then you could host it anywhere and you could maybe even kill sitecore CD servers that sounds pretty interesting right if you are in the side core World obviously if you are not and you're watching this I might say a lot of gibberish here but let's talk about how sidecar can work as a really good content repository for a system that you've been working with for years let's say and you don't need to do an update right what I'm going to show you works with even sitecore 8.2 it works with jss it works with sxa with all the things so let me show you where I work at uniform How We Do like sidecar still stays the same but your whole front-end experience is like so much more awesome so let's go so this here is a project that is running a uniform starter kit it's using a Scyther integration and a netlifier integration because that's where we can deploy our website and so you can go to Integrations you can see here I have my side core I have my URL my API key of course that's Now hidden because I don't want you to get my API key and you see I'm using habitat and so when you go to this tab here you can see on that URL just the standard sidecar habitat is running and it's working fine it's just how sideko would render it right and so um what we have here is uniforms platform or we call it a dxc that allows you to content edit as a Content editor with all different types of sources from you know e-commerce stuff to Legacy stuff that you integrate with yourself it's all quite Loosely coupled and it works really well because it kind of feels like experience editor from sitecore but it's agnostic to the tech it's much more free so if we just go to the home page here so this is a uniform starter kit running on next three that just released and it's querying side core data and so if you now click on let's say this hero here is he interested in getting started this is actually a Content item coming from sitecore like when you look here there's the data source with the sitecore icon right I can just hit edit here and so now I am here in sitecore where all that content is coming from right and we just selected it here I can also say let me just select another one maybe do flexibility select and so now that became the flexibility item from site course so side core becomes a data source where you can still content edit data model stuff you need but the presentation is completely separated and is elsewhere so I can actually go here and just go to currently this is my local host and there is everything and it kind of feels a little bit like you are in experience editor because you're editing what you see and there's even personalization stuff going on here and if you want to look at the code um this is fairly simple this is just a out of the box next three website that's running uniform here so the uniform SDK sits on top of next three queer uniform helps you query side core and you can do whatever you want there right so you can go to the pages and you can see here that actually it's using like getting the uniform composition for the slug that it's on at the moment and then it does some magic to actually query the data from uniform well it's not it's not that magical I just have a composable that query is an API route that will get the information from uniform get the information from sitecore Maps the the props of your data to the components and then run with it so this is my hero component and you can see here in the typescript it's giving the component which is a uniform component instance with all the data it needs and then I get the teaser title and the teaser summary and that's what you're seeing here right so when we go in here you can actually see there's a teaser image t-shirt title these are summary I could grab that image and show you on the page because this is just sidecar just became a data source and this works extremely well because I just chose next three I can also choose next 13 I can also choose Astro nobody cares as long as you have that little SDK that queries uniform all is good and so if we now go to Integrations and you want to add something else be my guest you can do Adobe AEM as yet another content Source or add Bigcommerce or Bluestone Bim anything goes right and this is a very interesting approach to how you would use sitecore but not get away from it because it's actually a great system to use it's just when you render with it on the front end it becomes very slow and when you use the sitecore approved approach you have to use for cell and next and it's very much tightly coupled to sidecar and that's what we don't want real composability is flexibility there shouldn't be any opinion and that's what this does for you and so that's what I wanted to show you today I hope this excites you a little bit it might also annoy you a little bit because I know in the sitecore world sitecore people love it right I love it too it has defined my career it's just another approach to solving a problem because the lovely thing with this is when we now deploy this to um let's say I don't know any Edge uniform could cache that on the edge for you for example or you can make a jam stick site and what that means is you can say goodbye to your CD servers which are very expensive to run that's pretty interesting right there's many approaches to solving a problem of building a website and this is one of them and I wanted to show you so cheers and I hope to see you next time bye
