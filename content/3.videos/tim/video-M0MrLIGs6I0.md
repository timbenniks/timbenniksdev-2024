title: "Vue.js guitar karaoke: how I built it"
description: "In this video, I explain how I created a Vue.js guitar karaoke system in which the browser controls everything. #vuejs and #nuxtjs deal with backing tracks, visualization, and guitar amp presets with midi. Users live-vote on which song I play next using #supabase.\n\nThe talk is called Alive and Kicking, a Vue into rock & roll. I did this talk in front of 1000 people at @VuejsAmsterdam in February 2023.\n\nThe code is open source: https://github.com/timbenniks/AliveAndKickingTalk\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:57 Signal chain\n02:50 Webmidi controls the guitar amp\n07:26 Live-voting with Supabase\n11:49 Animated avatars for real-time votes\n14:17 Ending\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.dev\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks"
