title: "Transforming DevRel with AI: Doorbell DevRel Explained"
description: "The Doorbell #devrel is an AI-driven content creation project that generates lifelike, unscripted developer marketing videos using minimal code and cutting-edge tools like @heygen_official, @elevenlabsio, @Contentstack, and @Cloudinary to produce authentic tech content at scale.\n\nhttps://doorbell-devrel.timbenniks.dev\n\nThere is too much 2b2 marketing with high production value, fancy buzzwords, and boring SEO copy. I'm one of these content creators, and at this point, it feels like I'm creating content so other marketers can copy the work. It is high time an expert speaks real words that actually help people achieve their dreams of building great websites.\n\nThis is the Doorbell DevRel. It's raw, off-the-cuff, and real. After a few successful doorbell videos, I decided to automate the process with AI to keep up with the demand.\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.dev\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks"
