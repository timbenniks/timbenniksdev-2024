title: "Transforming DevRel with AI: Doorbell DevRel Explained"
description: "The Doorbell #devrel is an AI-driven content creation project that generates lifelike, unscripted developer marketing videos using minimal code and cutting-edge tools like @heygen_official, @elevenlabsio, @Contentstack, and @Cloudinary to produce authentic tech content at scale.\n\nhttps://doorbell-devrel.timbenniks.dev\n\nThere is too much 2b2 marketing with high production value, fancy buzzwords, and boring SEO copy. I'm one of these content creators, and at this point, it feels like I'm creating content so other marketers can copy the work. It is high time an expert speaks real words that actually help people achieve their dreams of building great websites.\n\nThis is the Doorbell DevRel. It's raw, off-the-cuff, and real. After a few successful doorbell videos, I decided to automate the process with AI to keep up with the demand.\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.dev\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks"

transcript: "[Music] I am the doorbell devil I decided to record content on my ring doorbell instead of making hyper polished SEO friendly buzzword content only other marketers care about I'm going for low Tech High Impact content that serves people not search engines you know as it turns out creting videos with your doorbell is quite messy recording on a device that isn't really made for recording getting the footage on your computer editing it fixing the audio cropping it it all mounts up to lots of effort funnily enough making a video look low effort is actually super complex to make the process faster I decided to look into what I could do with AI you can actually get very far if you choose the right tools and Stitch their unique features together the last 10 or so videos I did were all fully generated with AI from my face to my voice to the background noise to the script everything uses a different AI tool I created a web interface that lets me select my avatar my voice what background noise I want and what intro I need I ask content stack brand kit AI for a script in my way of speaking it can do that based on a rich knowledge fault it has on on me I can even do it in different languages watch this in ACC I can also just put myself in my office instead so I can do some stuff with a slightly higher production quality but I can also just use the same talk track while I'm walking around with my phone in the garden by adding the different intros I can trick your brain into thinking these videos are real the Avatar model is clever and it sometimes even adjusts my glasses funnily enough I can't predict if the video output for this sentence actually adjusts the glasses while I talk about it that's all up to the Avatar using a ring camera adds to the realness as well these doorbell cameras look bad by default and therefore you wouldn't worry about artifacts in the video next to that I darken the video with a vignette and I make the audio sound horrible I know all this stuff is super cool but we have to think about the implications on our society I'm spending about 50 bucks a month and I can clone a convincing lifelike version of myself with this social experiment I fooled many people into thinking this is actually me imagine spending additional time tweaking and spending more cash with with this project I hopefully showed you the power of AI by combining a few tools and writing some clever code"
