transcript: "what is up welcome back to the channel so it's been a while because we've moved house i'm back in business ready to rock and this is one of the first videos that i'm doing in our new place and this is not really like a tech video but this is more like a little vlog because i'm here in our garden and just down there is our garage and currently it's used just to stack a whole bunch of stuff because that's what you do when you move and you have some space but i will be changing out the doors putting in windows and making a really nice workspace because i have decided i want to work from home from now on and so let's go there and i can show you because this is going to be part one of the youtube studio build vlog let's go this is going to be a bit bumpy because this stuff is really steep anyways here it goes and so all of this stuff is actually ours so when you move to the countryside in rural france this is what you can expect okay this is taking pretty long let's speed this up [Music] all right we're getting closer so there you can see where the garage is but i'm gonna have to walk around let's speed it up again this is the garage here behind me and you know why i chose to work here mainly because if you put windows in this one look this is what you get and so that's kind of a cool thing to look at while you work or at least try to work right and so it's next to the pool stuff so i'm a little worried i might have some like noise pollution but we'll see i might insulate it a little bit more this place is really quite full at the moment because we actually bought this house and a lot of furniture came with it and we just put it all here but look there's two windows um it's not fully insulated just yet there's some water damage that used to be here from before but the damage has been resolved everything is fixed so what i'll have to do is redo all the walls so these walls get new plaster they get some insulation of course i've never done that before so that's going to be fun and i'll make sure there's like power sockets and internet plugs every like three or four meters or so and i'll have to do something with the ceiling so as you can see this is like all like concrete blocks and so i'll have to make sure to insulate that as well because above here there's the sun pounding right and of course we have this door here this is like an old garage door but the thing is it's really shitty like there's all these bars and whatever shotty stuff here so i'm gonna have to remove all those buy or let build some windows and to put them in but with that oh man it's gonna look great anyways let's have a look at the few they're just ridiculous and it's just we're so lucky to actually have this and so that we can actually see this every day and hopefully it will never become normal and well how can this become normal it's just amazing what i get to do is when i have to go to the toilet or whatever actually i have to walk down this path to actually go to my house and then move a little bit because you know as developers we never move this is my buddy ollie he was allowed to go out for the first time today and he is so happy as you can see his paws a little dirty and his eyes are dirty because he's quite sick but he's still really enjoying this place so i've actually started designing like a 3d model of the office and i'm just trying to fiddle around with the stuff you can do so let's go inside and have a look at that all right so we are back in the temporary bedroom studio now and if you look at my screen these are the plans at least what i have for now for the studio and so you can see the space um so in meters it's 32.42 meters squared which is a really decent size for a workplace because what i have in mind is i want to work there i want to film on different places i want to have like a solid background i want to have like a little sofa where i sit and of course the desk queue like this but i also want to work with people right i'm going to work from home from now on but i want to be able to invite people and have them sit on a table or on the sofa and do meetings work things like that and so let's have a little look in 3d then so here it builds up webgl came a long way look how good this looks let's put the center point here so for now this is what i have i'm not sure if this is the way to go but these are like the windows that used to be garage doors and like these are the windows that we just saw on the outside in the video right and so i thought why not put electrical outlets in like all these different places let's see if i can show you right so these are all connected up electrical outlets here and i wanted to have a table you know for people to sit but i also wanted to have like a little sofa and then while i was deciding this suddenly a little tv area with a playstation came up i don't know if that's going to happen but who knows right and there's a little chair and air conditioning pretty important in a warm climate here in france and here's my desk with like a super fun old computer in the 3d render here but you know what this seems to be like quite homey so i'm thinking this might be good because what i have in mind for now is if i wanted to film i want to film against this wall here so i'll sit down put a camera in front of me and actually film myself against this little greenish wall then i want to be able to film while sitting on the sofa with my computer in the background and of course i want to have a view off the screen here so when we look at this thing in the proper 3d render like they actually used rtx and all the good stuff and the reflections to make this render props to this company cosi casa go there if you want to do anything in 3d like this anyways so look at that even the plants everything is decent this cost me some cash though but look how good it looks anyway so this is the initial thought that i had for the office i might have to change it up because you know what i'm missing here a workbench with tools because i know i live in the countryside we're gonna have to build a whole of a lot of stuff ourselves and so i don't have a place to store all my tools and stuff and so maybe i need to rethink this thing and do that and put like a little tool shed or something in it anyways if you have any ideas on this please put them in the comments because i'd love to like redesign this and iterate over it until it's great anyways that's it for the video it was short but sweet but there you go cheers and see you next time"
