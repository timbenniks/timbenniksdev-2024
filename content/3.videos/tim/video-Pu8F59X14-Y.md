description: "Based on high demand I'm hereby sharing my audio setup for 2020. I create YouTube videos, I make music and I do a ton of public speaking and conference calls. Audio is arguably more important than video so I did my research and put together an awesome setup for a fair price.\n\nIn this video I will go over audio basics, what you need at a minimum and what I chose as my tools for success. If this setup is not budget friendly enough make sure to watch until the end, I give cheaper alternatives that served me very well over the last year.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 Introduction\n01:18 My background in audio gear\n03:21 Audio Interface\n06:36 Microphone\n10:36 Audio caparison with and without gear\n11:08 Studio Monitors\n12:39 Headphones\n13:18 Monitor volume control\n15:03 Cheaper alternatives\n16:01 Alternative USB microphone\n17:13 Ultra cheap but awesome lav mic.\n18:10 Concluding\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.nl/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks"
