title: 5 tips to become a better web developer.
description: |-
  In this video I give you 5 tips you can apply to your daily work to a become a better developer. The tips are relatively easy to understand but take some effort to master. However, they can truly change your career! They sure changed mine for the better.

  Funny thing is: these tips have little to do with programming itself. Next to producing code, advancing your career is mostly done by having the right attitude, soft skills and taking responsibility for your work.

  I do a conference talk about this subject called Team First. Read more about that here: https://timbenniks.nl/writings/team-first/
