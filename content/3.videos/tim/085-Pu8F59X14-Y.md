title: My audio setup 2020
description: |-
  Based on high demand I'm hereby sharing my audio setup for 2020. I create YouTube videos, I make music and I do a ton of public speaking and conference calls. Audio is arguably more important than video so I did my research and put together an awesome setup for a fair price.

  In this video I will go over audio basics, what you need at a minimum and what I chose as my tools for success. If this setup is not budget friendly enough make sure to watch until the end, I give cheaper alternatives that served me very well over the last year.
