transcript: "my name is Tim Benniks and welcome back\nto the channel in this video it's me being interviewed rather than me\ninterviewing someone else this interview happened at the Vue.js Amsterdam\nconference where in the back they actually have a little studio where they\ninterview speakers and do a podcast and such normally they interview other\nspeakers after their talk about what I think of the conference and things like\nthat they did the same with me but because I'm collaborating with them\nto do stuff for my YouTube channel and their stuff that they do for the\ncommunity I actually get to publish my own\ninterview so this interview is around 25 minutes we go in-depth on how I do the\nwork that I do my philosophy about managing teams but also what I think\nabout the new headless revolution and how big CMS's are working on that so\nwithout further ado this is the interview with Tim Benniks me at Vue.js Amsterdam hello and welcome I'm Harris - the people here with Chris Passionate\nPeople and Tim Benniks we just delivered awesome speech on stage at\nAmsterdam that was about leadership and putting team first yeah let me ask you\nfirst right off the bat how do you like a conference this year of course cuz\nyou're a returning speaker so um I really love this conference and it's\nit's set up super well and the organizers they do a great job\nso yes I'm super happy that I had the honor to come back actually I would love\nto come back again but we'll see if that works because it's getting so famous now\neverybody wants to speak here it's true I do have to say and I'm speaking from a\npersonal perspective here because I cannot speak for everyone who's involved\nwith the conference but I think it's great to have you back here on stage oh\nthanks that's great thing it's really really nice also as having a talk that\ndoesn't focus on the pure of Vue.js aspect but also the things that are important\nwhen it comes to development which is not directly related to coding yeah\nexactly because there's a lot of conferences that go super technical and\nthen actually the tools that people need to get so technical I discussed those\nright and those are the tools that people need to be able to\nget the freedom to do that code so I think it's important that you have some\nsort of aspect of this every conference nice so can you tell us about your\ninteraction with Vue.js community so you could come to event like this but in\nthere during the rest of the year what's your relationship with Vue.js and the\ncommunity well since last year or maybe two years ago\nwe started a big project with Vue.js and it wasn't actually my choice but they\nsaid this is what we're using so go for it and then of course you're gonna have\nto use it and go deep and ask questions and that that worked well for a year we\ndid a bunch of for requests and starting to get a bit more involved and then 2019\ncame and I decided okay I need to talk about the work we do because it's pretty\ncool and a lot of people do this work but nobody speaks for them so I decided\nokay I'm going to do conference talks and the moment you go on stage you meet\nthose other people that are also in the few community and then I realized hey if\nI use Twitter I can actually talk to them because I was one of the first\nTwitter users and I just didn't use it and suddenly I started to tweet and\npeople tweeted back and cool stuff started to happen so community forms\nlike organically oh yeah that's how it how it happened so now you use Twitter\nmainly for your being in the loop actually I started using Twitter really\nfor work when I want to do anything work-related or code related or open\nsource related Twitter's is by far the best for me anyways and quite recently\nyou started using Twitter you know completely different sense would you\nmind sharing a little bit about that you you touched upon it when you started\nyour talk and then you moved on to your actual subject but maybe this is nice to\nsort of detail it a little bit more yes let's have a look at that so basically\nyou can of course also automate Twitter so I had this project or at least I had\nan idea and I made it into a project because I used to be fat as a kid all\nthe time it made me feel terrible and it took me a long time to realize how do I\nlose the weight and feel better again right so of many years ago I learned\nthat if I have a bit of like public accountability\nI actually make sure I keep doing it and now I moved to Paris I ate all the good\nfood and I started to gain a bit of weight again so I decided okay I need to\ndo a project with public accountability that fits in my scope of work so I\ndecided to build an application when I step on the scale in the morning it\nwould do all this automated stuff over the internet and it would eventually\npost a tweet so I would step in the morning on the scale and after ten\nseconds there's a tweet that says Tim waste as much and I used all these fancy\nnew technologies with Netley fine like basically everything that was discussed\ntoday I've actually used those tools to learn the tools to do my own project -\nyeah - to hook all those things together and today was actually my goal I didn't\nmake it not even by far but it was nested way though I mean I got\nimpressive yeah that's impressive nonetheless the thing is I try to keep\nit healthy because I could have made like I had to lose like 12 kilos in 3\nmonths I could probably do it but then how healthy is that I was just stupid\ncool either way it's pretty cool use of technology you know it taught me so much\nthat I made it talked about gem stack and surplice that hadn't didn't decide\nto do today because the guys asked me to talk about team first but that made me\nunderstand it and actually I made a talk about it so I'll do that in another\nconference now so you buy those projects you teach yourself and you open career\npossibilities because now I get to speak to Divya who works at Natalie Phi and I\ncan give her feedback on her product well there's not much feedback it's\ngreat but this is cool because you've now used it right so you should really\ndo this kind of stuff next to work if you have the time I'd say that's the\ngreat advice well for me it's a it comes I can't stop it so but not everybody has\nthat obviously but so you mentioned automation and there\nShanaya I wanted to ask you given your leadership position and role at your\ncompany and also the helicopter view yeah you have how do you see automation\ndisrupting developer jobs in the next five to ten years well I think it's\ngonna disrupt a lot if that's great or not I don't know I think for now we\nshould focus on automating processes like being able to deploy something very\nquickly for example or to automate your testing like we have so much room to win\nbefore we start automating what we code I think in the coming years you'll see a\nlot of tools where you do let's say what nettle if I already does I commit to get\nand suddenly the deploy happened well this is this kind of stuff is gonna come\nto enterprise because I work a lot in enterprise with those big systems and\nit's much harder to get it there but it's a lot brewing so all those big\nsystems from Enterprise are starting to do the Netlify style of work and people\nare starting to do cloud and docker containers and automating the\norchestration so I'd say in the coming years that we'll see first and then\nstart but that starts with smaller companies like next right\nand Natalie find that it all comes down to that and then it goes up and you also\nsee tools like Webflow where you can basically just drag and drop boxes and\nyou have a website these tools are great but they're not there yet like if you do\nit on the level where you have one website it goes to 60 markets with\nmillions of visitors you have to know exactly what you're doing to make that\nwork so automating that is not there yet I would say but it's our jobs are gonna\nbecome useless at one point useless useless even yes in ten years you have\nalgorithms to build the best stuff you have sorry you get algorithms that outer\nwill be able to code stuff for us right I'm not sure actually to be honest\nbecause it's such a humane job as well 11 because it requires a certain amount\nof creativity and a certain amount of problem-solving skills that I don't see\nalgorithmically solved or solved by statistically I in the next ten years\nwell ten years might be they usually yeah I think I think we're gonna reach\nthat points eventually but I'm not sure how it's gonna look like because in the\nend there's also people who need to write these algorithms and maintain them\nand sure there's all what there's always going to be work for us let's be honest\nyeah I just true I think we don't have to worry about that too much I think\nlike the the the way the work is going to look like they'll change over there\nover the coming years like it's changed dramatically over the past couple of\nyears you know moving away from like the jQuery style front ends and then the\nbackbone stop front ends and now we have you and react and angular and now web\ncomponents are becoming standard which is a thing of course and the whole\nservice workflow that we're now moving towards from like a back in perspective\nso there's so much in flux that I'm really excited to see where it's gonna\nguess but what I also realized though there's different segments of this\nmarket right so the smaller websites they will be much more automated and I\nthink also there's all these companies that do this amazing black magic that\nyou don't know how that got so quickly deployed so that kind of automation will\nhappen though like if you go to bigger projects or more specific ones clearly\nwill have a job but everything riding up to it like all the word presses that\nkeep small they might be automated yeah my new ones myself a little bit it's\nokay okay wait you see this now already with as you say like with net the fine\nit'll fly CMS and yeah things like Gatsby on the react side and the whole\nmovement towards headless CMS is where you update your content it triggers like\nthis cult called native flow where it pushes your content as you say what I\nfind interesting though is that you said like on the enterprise level you see\nthis movement happening but it's a lot more slowly why do you think that is\nthat it is so so so well if you look for example like a like a company like site\ncore site core is .net CMS it's one of the biggest out there and they are\namazing for content editing workflows they're great so for the last 10 years\nwhat they have sold is a monolith so you edit your content and you personalize\nyour content for users and you do that in a nice graphical interface\nand when you hit safe it's there you have that all in the same nice system\nbut then this hatless trend is coming and they're like okay but if we remain\nwhere we are now in a couple of years everybody does this hat listing and we\nare not yeah they don't want to buy our product anymore\nthe thing is also they're feeling this heat a little bit so they're starting to\nput that in and they're doing it really well but they have this one caveat for\n10 years their salt that one experience that works extremely well and then when\nyou start marketing yes but we are also hatless do this now you invalidate those\nlast 10 years of people that paid you millions to use this globally so they\nneed to find an in-between way to keep that old experience of amazing content\nediting plus then this hatless thing that we as developers are happy with so\nit's gonna take longer for them to make that mature because they're basically\ninitially they add this headless part into the monolith so at least that works\nor you can do the content anything in your application and then once you serve\nit to the user then it becomes truly headless and you take it out but they\nactually had to complexify their tools to their tool chain to do that and that\ntakes time and effort and it needs to mature and it takes some years because\nthen you have a company like where I work we do this huge scale for one\ninstance that would have five web sites and each web site is different and has a\nproduct catalog and it has different search ways ways to search and redirects\nand user influx of data there's so much going on if we just throw all that\ncomplexity against the tool that was just coming out that's just challenging\nso I'm not saying it's bad it's actually great but it takes some time and all of\nthem are relatively in the same space now so yeah that's why it takes a bit\nlonger okay well I got another question one ask you about leadership styles I\nsee that you are very young kind and a friendly personality thank\nyou so I would assume you're also leading\nyour team with certain kindness and empathy sure can you\nlike you explained what have you learned in your leadership career and what\nStyles work and which tiles don't and just tell us more about that aspect well\nhow I started is quite strange but based on that I learned a lot from that and I\nuse that day-to-day so I grew up being a musician so I played music all the time\nand then I realized okay I'm just paying money to tour rather than getting money\nit's a hard job and then so I wanted this backup and I became a nurse so I\nwent to school to be a nurse and I work in psychiatry and then at school what we\nlearned is to have a discussion with someone and imagine someone is very sick\nand you have to give them bad news the way you deliver that is very specific\nand you have to we had to videotape ourselves every day doing this kind of\ntalks with people and just understand what you say matters a lot especially if\nyou are in the white coat as a doctor and someone else is not there's this\njustice difference so that's the one part that makes it complex and you learn\na lot from that so you will see yourself speaking to someone if you sit like this\nor that that has impact and then next to that this is it sounds a bit black and\nwhite but there's a difference between nurses and doctors in how they operate\nin their lives let's say so nurse this is just black and right right so it's\nit's never like that but nurses tend to be people are really focused on the\ncontent so they read a whole book and argue from there I'm definitely a person\nlike that but then a doctor on the other side is amazing at reading a room and be\nable to speak not knowing everything because the doctor can just not know\neverything there's so much to learn and both of those can get like an A or a tan\non a test because you just understand your context and understand what to do\nbut if you're a nurse and you go to a doctor you say I need this isn't this\nwith that patient they won't listen because they're too busy and it just you\ngo with so much content to them so what we learned is how to manipulate them\nslightly to go on their level talk about their day or whatever they liked and\nfive seconds in and then you ask the question they'll listen to you\nand I always thought why do I need to learn all this there's so much\nconversational stuff and manipulation going on and now when I'm in front of\nthe like the CEO of whatever big company we work for it's exactly the same thing\nso you need to adjust the levels you adjust the levels you read the room and\nyou just are able to understand how they think or try anyways because most of you\nat that level they are so smart they already understand everything and they\nhave 50 meetings a day so you have to do it in 30 seconds get it across but also\ndo it in such a way that they understand you and of course this is with clients\nbut when you understand this concept when you do it with your team it also\nworks but I don't do the manipulation bit obviously but just see the people\nlike I was a developer once or I'm still am but everybody comes up so just trust\npeople there to me everybody is good at at the core and on whatever comes around\nin their lives could change you but I always trust them and I actually don't\nalways like we do job interviews right in the first job and if you had never\nasked about code they don't even care I want to know can you speak can you\ncommunicate clearly can you write something are you kind do\nyou fit the team and once that works then we go to the next step so you\ncreate this balance of people that fit your team so if you have a team of how\ndo you save like nice guys or nice girls and you add a primadonna\ninto it like a badass code or think I am the best it's never gonna work but\nsometimes you just need three prima donnas to do amazing stuff make build a\nfacebook let them go away and come back or you have a team of a bit more nice\npeople that are well nice is not the right word everybody can be nice but\nthere are less outspoken or less personal driven so you need to find the\nbalance in the teams and at work we sometimes even do like exercises like\nwhat color are you are you caring or are you quickly annoyed or and then you\nteach yourself about yourself or about others and then we we put people\ntogether and that tends to work really well there's been a situation where\nbeing empathic as you are was a detriment rather than the benefit in\nyour work situation well the thing is this is what you get with how I\nsometimes work is I want to have meaning in my work and I want the people who\ngive me the job to be happy you have that in your personal life but also in\nwork so you have all these different personality types and I'm kind of like\nthe word pleaser doesn't sound great but in that context this is kind of where I\ncould fit and so sometimes I just work so much because I want to make everybody\nhappy and so you need to learn when to say no and especially when you get a bit\nmore known in the community for example or you work in a bigger company and they\nknow you will like when they put me on it it will just work but that's also can\nbe a detriment for sure because I've I've been known to work a lot and that's\nnot always good like find your balance in life is important some wise words\nright there yeah but I have to be like 35 to only start understanding this\nright it takes me took me a long time and I'm not there yet but I think being\nreflective of what you do is super important like and I always ask feedback\nand it's not always easy because I live in France and people are not super\ndirect but then when they do it's really insightful because people are like hi\nthinkers in France and it's great and just I always reflect do I still like my\njob am I still giving fail you do I still have autonomy constantly and it\ncan also be very annoying for my boss because they might be like oh but is he\nleaving or what is he looking for so I have learned the hard way that I\nshouldn't do that too much because then it looks like I'm never really there\neven though I am because I'm really loyal alright so there's always pitfalls\nsure you learn from your mistakes you can tell abut your mistakes you made\nthat made you learn and grow the most well what I have actually the best thing\nis moving to France for me because I am not good at language like English I'm\nkind of alright because I've had to speak it my whole life\nbut then speaking French I'm like a child again and the thing is it made me\nspeak slower and listen more because I have a fast\nbrain it doesn't mean that it's good it's just fast so I sometimes speak over\npeople or make very quick assumptions and I'm lucky that I have a lot of\nexperience so I tend to have quick assumptions that are tend to be alright\nbecause I've done it before but that can really give you issues right especially\nif you're in front of a client you assume something it's really not true\nthat's not a good thing to be in that position so moving to France making me\nspeak less and think more that really helped me a lot alright I think there's\nanother talk in there it can be depending on your culture of course and\nis so for a Dutch person like me who speaks fast speaks a lot things quickly\nit's really a good thing to do but yeah also people who procrastinate and think\ndeeply a lot but then do nothing right so you have to always find the time but\nthere's always a where yeah of course it's really awesome to talk with you I\nthink we could go on yes probably that's why I did to talk about it there's a\nquestion we asked everyone at the end fun question so Chris you wanna yes yes\nyes so what we are most interested in is when you are coding intensively what do\nyou like to drink but I like to drink yes woah that that changes over time\nright now it's just water I drink a lot of water but that's just because I like\nit but never alcohol never alcohol no only after or before alright so there's\nno sir there's no Steve Ballmer peak to be had with you who knows no but like\nthis is really great of working where I work we work with so many different\ncultures and lately especially the people in Brazil we work with them a lot\nand the cool thing is they're super happy that we help them but they\nactually the help is way more but they don't realize it but they give keep\ngiving as presents and it's always alcohol or like peanuts or\nlike candies so now that if it's there yeah I'll take it\nsorry I think nothing's on this table here I was fat for a reason so maybe\nthis alcohol it is consumed it is conserved but not while coding generally\nall right I always give it like this is one fun thing like we work for Rolex the\nthe awesome watch company and one day a package arrives on my desk and it was\nreally big I'm like that's interesting open it up super nice Rolex box and\nMichael they didn't give me a watch right no of course not they gave me\nchocolates but like the most amazing chocolates you've ever seen properly\naligned with the Rolex logo on it in a golden piece of paper in a big box and\nso now that I'm older I didn't eat them myself I gave them to all my colleagues\nbecause I'm a manager so I got them because I did a lot for this client but\nactually the team did it so now that I'm trying to lose some weight I just yeah\nyou don't need to eat it all no right just have a sample oh I did yeah let's\ngo now it's amazing how how you can ship chocolates from Geneva in a big box so\nthey don't move there's like bedding like that right what's amazing yeah but\neverything they do is the most amazing it can be so if you do chocolates why\nnot it's their it's their brand of course exactly their brand is big so\nperfect ultimate quality brands take so perfect and so I'm really honored to\nwork with these guys to to learn what it means to have the the perfect shot or\nthe perfect 3d render or the perfect video on a website and still make it\nfast because that's challenging is when I say you have to optimize them no no no\nno we were having the the most pixels possible so it looks perfect\nso you need to find your way around it and then but this is a great challenge I\ncan imagine yeah and that website is amazing is the\nmost smooth animations you've ever seen I think we need to have a second podcast\nwith Tim explaining about how we optimized for a client like Rolex that\ndemands nothing but the best there you go\nI was really happy that I did that many years for Chanel they are similar\nthey're not the same brands clearly there's in a different space but it's\namazing they have two discussions with their the people that make the bags or\ntake the pictures the the story behind that brand is so amazing there's so much\nthere and you feel proud as a developer that you can actually show that on a\npage and you start of start to like the story of the lady herself and how she\nemancipate and so giving a story behind you what you build that is super cool so\nI'm lucky that I had that yeah I think yeah we could talk yes yes so\ninteresting yeah I think we need to wrap up sure has been amazing thank you thank\nyou very much thank you Chris thank you Tim thank you cool thank you for\nlisteners to tune in bye bye bye"
