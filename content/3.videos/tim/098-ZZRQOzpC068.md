transcript: |-
  my name is Tim Benniks and welcome back
  to the channel in this video it's me being interviewed rather than me
  interviewing someone else this interview happened at the Vue.js Amsterdam
  conference where in the back they actually have a little studio where they
  interview speakers and do a podcast and such normally they interview other
  speakers after their talk about what I think of the conference and things like
  that they did the same with me but because I'm collaborating with them
  to do stuff for my YouTube channel and their stuff that they do for the
  community I actually get to publish my own
  interview so this interview is around 25 minutes we go in-depth on how I do the
  work that I do my philosophy about managing teams but also what I think
  about the new headless revolution and how big CMS's are working on that so
  without further ado this is the interview with Tim Benniks me at Vue.js Amsterdam hello and welcome I'm Harris - the people here with Chris Passionate
  People and Tim Benniks we just delivered awesome speech on stage at
  Amsterdam that was about leadership and putting team first yeah let me ask you
  first right off the bat how do you like a conference this year of course cuz
  you're a returning speaker so um I really love this conference and it's
  it's set up super well and the organizers they do a great job
  so yes I'm super happy that I had the honor to come back actually I would love
  to come back again but we'll see if that works because it's getting so famous now
  everybody wants to speak here it's true I do have to say and I'm speaking from a
  personal perspective here because I cannot speak for everyone who's involved
  with the conference but I think it's great to have you back here on stage oh
  thanks that's great thing it's really really nice also as having a talk that
  doesn't focus on the pure of Vue.js aspect but also the things that are important
  when it comes to development which is not directly related to coding yeah
  exactly because there's a lot of conferences that go super technical and
  then actually the tools that people need to get so technical I discussed those
  right and those are the tools that people need to be able to
  get the freedom to do that code so I think it's important that you have some
  sort of aspect of this every conference nice so can you tell us about your
  interaction with Vue.js community so you could come to event like this but in
  there during the rest of the year what's your relationship with Vue.js and the
  community well since last year or maybe two years ago
  we started a big project with Vue.js and it wasn't actually my choice but they
  said this is what we're using so go for it and then of course you're gonna have
  to use it and go deep and ask questions and that that worked well for a year we
  did a bunch of for requests and starting to get a bit more involved and then 2019
  came and I decided okay I need to talk about the work we do because it's pretty
  cool and a lot of people do this work but nobody speaks for them so I decided
  okay I'm going to do conference talks and the moment you go on stage you meet
  those other people that are also in the few community and then I realized hey if
  I use Twitter I can actually talk to them because I was one of the first
  Twitter users and I just didn't use it and suddenly I started to tweet and
  people tweeted back and cool stuff started to happen so community forms
  like organically oh yeah that's how it how it happened so now you use Twitter
  mainly for your being in the loop actually I started using Twitter really
  for work when I want to do anything work-related or code related or open
  source related Twitter's is by far the best for me anyways and quite recently
  you started using Twitter you know completely different sense would you
  mind sharing a little bit about that you you touched upon it when you started
  your talk and then you moved on to your actual subject but maybe this is nice to
  sort of detail it a little bit more yes let's have a look at that so basically
  you can of course also automate Twitter so I had this project or at least I had
  an idea and I made it into a project because I used to be fat as a kid all
  the time it made me feel terrible and it took me a long time to realize how do I
  lose the weight and feel better again right so of many years ago I learned
  that if I have a bit of like public accountability
  I actually make sure I keep doing it and now I moved to Paris I ate all the good
  food and I started to gain a bit of weight again so I decided okay I need to
  do a project with public accountability that fits in my scope of work so I
  decided to build an application when I step on the scale in the morning it
  would do all this automated stuff over the internet and it would eventually
  post a tweet so I would step in the morning on the scale and after ten
  seconds there's a tweet that says Tim waste as much and I used all these fancy
  new technologies with Netley fine like basically everything that was discussed
  today I've actually used those tools to learn the tools to do my own project -
  yeah - to hook all those things together and today was actually my goal I didn't
  make it not even by far but it was nested way though I mean I got
  impressive yeah that's impressive nonetheless the thing is I try to keep
  it healthy because I could have made like I had to lose like 12 kilos in 3
  months I could probably do it but then how healthy is that I was just stupid
  cool either way it's pretty cool use of technology you know it taught me so much
  that I made it talked about gem stack and surplice that hadn't didn't decide
  to do today because the guys asked me to talk about team first but that made me
  understand it and actually I made a talk about it so I'll do that in another
  conference now so you buy those projects you teach yourself and you open career
  possibilities because now I get to speak to Divya who works at Natalie Phi and I
  can give her feedback on her product well there's not much feedback it's
  great but this is cool because you've now used it right so you should really
  do this kind of stuff next to work if you have the time I'd say that's the
  great advice well for me it's a it comes I can't stop it so but not everybody has
  that obviously but so you mentioned automation and there
  Shanaya I wanted to ask you given your leadership position and role at your
  company and also the helicopter view yeah you have how do you see automation
  disrupting developer jobs in the next five to ten years well I think it's
  gonna disrupt a lot if that's great or not I don't know I think for now we
  should focus on automating processes like being able to deploy something very
  quickly for example or to automate your testing like we have so much room to win
  before we start automating what we code I think in the coming years you'll see a
  lot of tools where you do let's say what nettle if I already does I commit to get
  and suddenly the deploy happened well this is this kind of stuff is gonna come
  to enterprise because I work a lot in enterprise with those big systems and
  it's much harder to get it there but it's a lot brewing so all those big
  systems from Enterprise are starting to do the Netlify style of work and people
  are starting to do cloud and docker containers and automating the
  orchestration so I'd say in the coming years that we'll see first and then
  start but that starts with smaller companies like next right
  and Natalie find that it all comes down to that and then it goes up and you also
  see tools like Webflow where you can basically just drag and drop boxes and
  you have a website these tools are great but they're not there yet like if you do
  it on the level where you have one website it goes to 60 markets with
  millions of visitors you have to know exactly what you're doing to make that
  work so automating that is not there yet I would say but it's our jobs are gonna
  become useless at one point useless useless even yes in ten years you have
  algorithms to build the best stuff you have sorry you get algorithms that outer
  will be able to code stuff for us right I'm not sure actually to be honest
  because it's such a humane job as well 11 because it requires a certain amount
  of creativity and a certain amount of problem-solving skills that I don't see
  algorithmically solved or solved by statistically I in the next ten years
  well ten years might be they usually yeah I think I think we're gonna reach
  that points eventually but I'm not sure how it's gonna look like because in the
  end there's also people who need to write these algorithms and maintain them
  and sure there's all what there's always going to be work for us let's be honest
  yeah I just true I think we don't have to worry about that too much I think
  like the the the way the work is going to look like they'll change over there
  over the coming years like it's changed dramatically over the past couple of
  years you know moving away from like the jQuery style front ends and then the
  backbone stop front ends and now we have you and react and angular and now web
  components are becoming standard which is a thing of course and the whole
  service workflow that we're now moving towards from like a back in perspective
  so there's so much in flux that I'm really excited to see where it's gonna
  guess but what I also realized though there's different segments of this
  market right so the smaller websites they will be much more automated and I
  think also there's all these companies that do this amazing black magic that
  you don't know how that got so quickly deployed so that kind of automation will
  happen though like if you go to bigger projects or more specific ones clearly
  will have a job but everything riding up to it like all the word presses that
  keep small they might be automated yeah my new ones myself a little bit it's
  okay okay wait you see this now already with as you say like with net the fine
  it'll fly CMS and yeah things like Gatsby on the react side and the whole
  movement towards headless CMS is where you update your content it triggers like
  this cult called native flow where it pushes your content as you say what I
  find interesting though is that you said like on the enterprise level you see
  this movement happening but it's a lot more slowly why do you think that is
  that it is so so so well if you look for example like a like a company like site
  core site core is .net CMS it's one of the biggest out there and they are
  amazing for content editing workflows they're great so for the last 10 years
  what they have sold is a monolith so you edit your content and you personalize
  your content for users and you do that in a nice graphical interface
  and when you hit safe it's there you have that all in the same nice system
  but then this hatless trend is coming and they're like okay but if we remain
  where we are now in a couple of years everybody does this hat listing and we
  are not yeah they don't want to buy our product anymore
  the thing is also they're feeling this heat a little bit so they're starting to
  put that in and they're doing it really well but they have this one caveat for
  10 years their salt that one experience that works extremely well and then when
  you start marketing yes but we are also hatless do this now you invalidate those
  last 10 years of people that paid you millions to use this globally so they
  need to find an in-between way to keep that old experience of amazing content
  editing plus then this hatless thing that we as developers are happy with so
  it's gonna take longer for them to make that mature because they're basically
  initially they add this headless part into the monolith so at least that works
  or you can do the content anything in your application and then once you serve
  it to the user then it becomes truly headless and you take it out but they
  actually had to complexify their tools to their tool chain to do that and that
  takes time and effort and it needs to mature and it takes some years because
  then you have a company like where I work we do this huge scale for one
  instance that would have five web sites and each web site is different and has a
  product catalog and it has different search ways ways to search and redirects
  and user influx of data there's so much going on if we just throw all that
  complexity against the tool that was just coming out that's just challenging
  so I'm not saying it's bad it's actually great but it takes some time and all of
  them are relatively in the same space now so yeah that's why it takes a bit
  longer okay well I got another question one ask you about leadership styles I
  see that you are very young kind and a friendly personality thank
  you so I would assume you're also leading
  your team with certain kindness and empathy sure can you
  like you explained what have you learned in your leadership career and what
  Styles work and which tiles don't and just tell us more about that aspect well
  how I started is quite strange but based on that I learned a lot from that and I
  use that day-to-day so I grew up being a musician so I played music all the time
  and then I realized okay I'm just paying money to tour rather than getting money
  it's a hard job and then so I wanted this backup and I became a nurse so I
  went to school to be a nurse and I work in psychiatry and then at school what we
  learned is to have a discussion with someone and imagine someone is very sick
  and you have to give them bad news the way you deliver that is very specific
  and you have to we had to videotape ourselves every day doing this kind of
  talks with people and just understand what you say matters a lot especially if
  you are in the white coat as a doctor and someone else is not there's this
  justice difference so that's the one part that makes it complex and you learn
  a lot from that so you will see yourself speaking to someone if you sit like this
  or that that has impact and then next to that this is it sounds a bit black and
  white but there's a difference between nurses and doctors in how they operate
  in their lives let's say so nurse this is just black and right right so it's
  it's never like that but nurses tend to be people are really focused on the
  content so they read a whole book and argue from there I'm definitely a person
  like that but then a doctor on the other side is amazing at reading a room and be
  able to speak not knowing everything because the doctor can just not know
  everything there's so much to learn and both of those can get like an A or a tan
  on a test because you just understand your context and understand what to do
  but if you're a nurse and you go to a doctor you say I need this isn't this
  with that patient they won't listen because they're too busy and it just you
  go with so much content to them so what we learned is how to manipulate them
  slightly to go on their level talk about their day or whatever they liked and
  five seconds in and then you ask the question they'll listen to you
  and I always thought why do I need to learn all this there's so much
  conversational stuff and manipulation going on and now when I'm in front of
  the like the CEO of whatever big company we work for it's exactly the same thing
  so you need to adjust the levels you adjust the levels you read the room and
  you just are able to understand how they think or try anyways because most of you
  at that level they are so smart they already understand everything and they
  have 50 meetings a day so you have to do it in 30 seconds get it across but also
  do it in such a way that they understand you and of course this is with clients
  but when you understand this concept when you do it with your team it also
  works but I don't do the manipulation bit obviously but just see the people
  like I was a developer once or I'm still am but everybody comes up so just trust
  people there to me everybody is good at at the core and on whatever comes around
  in their lives could change you but I always trust them and I actually don't
  always like we do job interviews right in the first job and if you had never
  asked about code they don't even care I want to know can you speak can you
  communicate clearly can you write something are you kind do
  you fit the team and once that works then we go to the next step so you
  create this balance of people that fit your team so if you have a team of how
  do you save like nice guys or nice girls and you add a primadonna
  into it like a badass code or think I am the best it's never gonna work but
  sometimes you just need three prima donnas to do amazing stuff make build a
  facebook let them go away and come back or you have a team of a bit more nice
  people that are well nice is not the right word everybody can be nice but
  there are less outspoken or less personal driven so you need to find the
  balance in the teams and at work we sometimes even do like exercises like
  what color are you are you caring or are you quickly annoyed or and then you
  teach yourself about yourself or about others and then we we put people
  together and that tends to work really well there's been a situation where
  being empathic as you are was a detriment rather than the benefit in
  your work situation well the thing is this is what you get with how I
  sometimes work is I want to have meaning in my work and I want the people who
  give me the job to be happy you have that in your personal life but also in
  work so you have all these different personality types and I'm kind of like
  the word pleaser doesn't sound great but in that context this is kind of where I
  could fit and so sometimes I just work so much because I want to make everybody
  happy and so you need to learn when to say no and especially when you get a bit
  more known in the community for example or you work in a bigger company and they
  know you will like when they put me on it it will just work but that's also can
  be a detriment for sure because I've I've been known to work a lot and that's
  not always good like find your balance in life is important some wise words
  right there yeah but I have to be like 35 to only start understanding this
  right it takes me took me a long time and I'm not there yet but I think being
  reflective of what you do is super important like and I always ask feedback
  and it's not always easy because I live in France and people are not super
  direct but then when they do it's really insightful because people are like hi
  thinkers in France and it's great and just I always reflect do I still like my
  job am I still giving fail you do I still have autonomy constantly and it
  can also be very annoying for my boss because they might be like oh but is he
  leaving or what is he looking for so I have learned the hard way that I
  shouldn't do that too much because then it looks like I'm never really there
  even though I am because I'm really loyal alright so there's always pitfalls
  sure you learn from your mistakes you can tell abut your mistakes you made
  that made you learn and grow the most well what I have actually the best thing
  is moving to France for me because I am not good at language like English I'm
  kind of alright because I've had to speak it my whole life
  but then speaking French I'm like a child again and the thing is it made me
  speak slower and listen more because I have a fast
  brain it doesn't mean that it's good it's just fast so I sometimes speak over
  people or make very quick assumptions and I'm lucky that I have a lot of
  experience so I tend to have quick assumptions that are tend to be alright
  because I've done it before but that can really give you issues right especially
  if you're in front of a client you assume something it's really not true
  that's not a good thing to be in that position so moving to France making me
  speak less and think more that really helped me a lot alright I think there's
  another talk in there it can be depending on your culture of course and
  is so for a Dutch person like me who speaks fast speaks a lot things quickly
  it's really a good thing to do but yeah also people who procrastinate and think
  deeply a lot but then do nothing right so you have to always find the time but
  there's always a where yeah of course it's really awesome to talk with you I
  think we could go on yes probably that's why I did to talk about it there's a
  question we asked everyone at the end fun question so Chris you wanna yes yes
  yes so what we are most interested in is when you are coding intensively what do
  you like to drink but I like to drink yes woah that that changes over time
  right now it's just water I drink a lot of water but that's just because I like
  it but never alcohol never alcohol no only after or before alright so there's
  no sir there's no Steve Ballmer peak to be had with you who knows no but like
  this is really great of working where I work we work with so many different
  cultures and lately especially the people in Brazil we work with them a lot
  and the cool thing is they're super happy that we help them but they
  actually the help is way more but they don't realize it but they give keep
  giving as presents and it's always alcohol or like peanuts or
  like candies so now that if it's there yeah I'll take it
  sorry I think nothing's on this table here I was fat for a reason so maybe
  this alcohol it is consumed it is conserved but not while coding generally
  all right I always give it like this is one fun thing like we work for Rolex the
  the awesome watch company and one day a package arrives on my desk and it was
  really big I'm like that's interesting open it up super nice Rolex box and
  Michael they didn't give me a watch right no of course not they gave me
  chocolates but like the most amazing chocolates you've ever seen properly
  aligned with the Rolex logo on it in a golden piece of paper in a big box and
  so now that I'm older I didn't eat them myself I gave them to all my colleagues
  because I'm a manager so I got them because I did a lot for this client but
  actually the team did it so now that I'm trying to lose some weight I just yeah
  you don't need to eat it all no right just have a sample oh I did yeah let's
  go now it's amazing how how you can ship chocolates from Geneva in a big box so
  they don't move there's like bedding like that right what's amazing yeah but
  everything they do is the most amazing it can be so if you do chocolates why
  not it's their it's their brand of course exactly their brand is big so
  perfect ultimate quality brands take so perfect and so I'm really honored to
  work with these guys to to learn what it means to have the the perfect shot or
  the perfect 3d render or the perfect video on a website and still make it
  fast because that's challenging is when I say you have to optimize them no no no
  no we were having the the most pixels possible so it looks perfect
  so you need to find your way around it and then but this is a great challenge I
  can imagine yeah and that website is amazing is the
  most smooth animations you've ever seen I think we need to have a second podcast
  with Tim explaining about how we optimized for a client like Rolex that
  demands nothing but the best there you go
  I was really happy that I did that many years for Chanel they are similar
  they're not the same brands clearly there's in a different space but it's
  amazing they have two discussions with their the people that make the bags or
  take the pictures the the story behind that brand is so amazing there's so much
  there and you feel proud as a developer that you can actually show that on a
  page and you start of start to like the story of the lady herself and how she
  emancipate and so giving a story behind you what you build that is super cool so
  I'm lucky that I had that yeah I think yeah we could talk yes yes so
  interesting yeah I think we need to wrap up sure has been amazing thank you thank
  you very much thank you Chris thank you Tim thank you cool thank you for
  listeners to tune in bye bye bye
