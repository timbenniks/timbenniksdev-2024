description: "I had the privilege to interview Jen Looper. Jen is a cloud advocate lead at Microsoft, she is the founder of Front-end Foxes (previously Vue Vixens) and she is a seasoned speaker and developress.\n\nWe had a lovely wide-ranging conversation where we learn about how she came up during the first Internet bubble, managing work and life with kids and starting Front-end Foxes.\n\nIn this video series I interview people that are amazing at their jobs in the tech industry. I try to find out what makes these people shine - how to they deliver such high quality work? What tools and best practices do they recommend?\n\nFollow Jen here:\nWebsite: https://jenlooper.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jenlooper\nFront-end Foxes: https://www.vuevixens.org\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.nl\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks"
