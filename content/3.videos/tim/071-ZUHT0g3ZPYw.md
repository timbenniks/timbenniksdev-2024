title: "Tim Tries: Figma, Zeplin and Storybook. Mind is blown..."
description: "I sometimes just try out new tech or web services for the first time and give my feedback as I go. This is the #timtries Series. In this video I look at Figma, Zeplin and Storybook. I recently learnt how nicely all these tools integrate so developers get a MUCH better DX. Zeplin acts as the hub and the creative source of truth for development, QA, business analysts, UX and creative people.\n\nConclusion: Mind is blown... Zeplin CLI is amazing.\nDisclaimer: this content is not sponsored and my opinions are honest and real time.\n\nFollow me here:\nBuy me a coffee: https://www.buymeacoff.ee/timbenniks\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.dev/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks"
