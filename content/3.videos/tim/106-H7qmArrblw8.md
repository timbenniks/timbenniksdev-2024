title: "An interview with Maya Shavin: When you have the force, nothing is impossible!"
description: "In this video series I interview people that are amazing at their job in the tech industry. I try to find the tools and best practices they use to shine on conference stages, contribute to open source projects or when they deliver high quality work.\n\nBeware, this is my first interview. Please leave your feedback in the comments :)\n\nIn this installment I'm speaking to Maya Shavin. Maya is a senior web developer in the R&D team at Cloudinary. Next to being a great developer she is also a speaker, a writer and she organizes events. We dive deep (yep, 47 minutes) into how she has such an amazing output and how she deals with the challenges of culture clash, family life and being a woman in a male dominated arena.\n\nMaya truly has the force! Watch until the end where she explains her mantra to success.\n\nFollow Maya here:\nhttps://www.mayashavin.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/MayaShavin\nhttps://www.cloudinary.com\n\nFollow me here:\nWebsite: https://timbenniks.nl/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/timbenniks\nGithub: https://github.com/timbenniks"
