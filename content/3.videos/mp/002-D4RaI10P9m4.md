title: JSWorld Conference 2023 Vlog
description: |-
  Marc and Tim explored backstage at the JSWorld conference, one of the biggest JS conferences in the world. Camera in one hand, microphone in the other, capturing the vibe, the technology used, and how the speakers feel about their talks.

  This is Middleware Productions: we film interviews, shoot b-roll, create story arcs, video-edit, and sound-edit, and publish the video on the day. Film in the morning, show in the afternoon.
