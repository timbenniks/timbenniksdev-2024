description: "At the biggest Vue.js event in the world, @themarcba and @timbenniks explored backstage. Camera in one hand, microphone in the other, capturing the vibe, the technology used, and how the speakers feel about their talks.\n\nThis is Middleware Productions: we film interviews, shoot b-roll, create story arcs, video edit, sound edit, and publish the video on the day itself. Film in the morning, show in the afternoon."
