title: Vue.js Amsterdam 2024
description: |-
  At the biggest Vue.js event in the world,  @themarcba  and  @timbenniks  explored backstage. Camera in one hand, microphone in the other, capturing the vibe, the technology used, and how the speakers feel about their talks.

  This is Middleware Productions: we film interviews, shoot b-roll, create story arcs, video edit, sound edit, and publish the video on the day itself. Film in the morning, show in the afternoon.
