description: "In beautiful Barcelona, Tim & Marc joined a warm chapter of Vue.js Roadtrips organized by Passionate People. They interviewed speakers and captured the vibe around the event.\n\nThis is Middleware Productions: we film interviews, shoot b-roll, create story arcs, edit, sound edit, and publish the video on the day itself. Film in the morning, show in the afternoon."
