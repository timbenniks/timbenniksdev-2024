transcript: "[Music] hey everybody How's it going Tim all good We have such a good stream today It's going to be fun Yeah I'm so excited Welcome everyone to um Content Stack Polls for developers Today we have a fantastic stream for you We're going to be talking about all things Automate Um and we have a very special guest senior product manager for Automate and Brand Kit and AI assistant Christine Masters Everyone welcome Christine Masters to the stage I want an applause sound We just don't have it I wish we had an applause sound but there we go Welcome Very good Very good So excited to be here and talk to you guys This is super cool Oh this is going to be a whole lot of fun So we just  you up like a lot So we Let's deliver now Let's Sorry that was really serious I didn't mean that Christine We're just going to have fun So this is like a webinar We're just gonna have We're going to show you some stuff And so maybe one question before we kick it off Can you explain like for the folks that don't know what automate is because it's very generic term like maybe give us the elevator pitch and then it's all yours Yeah let me show I have a couple of slides and I know developers are kind of allergic to slides but um Oh it's great Um but so so yeah so we'll we'll try to do this really really quick but I think you know as a product person I think in slideshows so it you know you have to kind of get on my page a little bit as as we're talking about this but I'll go through this very quickly Um so just to sort of get started I wanted to talk a little bit about practical use cases with automate and AI Um we started off obviously a couple years ago working on automation and then you know chat GPT came out and we built it into the automation platform and the two things together are obviously really really powerful Um taking an automation and adding AI as kind of like the brains behind it is just really really cool and we'll show a lot of that today Um I'm super excited to to share some some of those examples but I wanted to talk for just a second just about some of these use cases like so over here we have sort of the traditional idea of generative UI of generative AI where you're writing a blog post redoing the headline you know that kind of very external facing stuff right but then over here I want to make sure people understand that there's a whole bunch of stuff that you can do with AI and automation that isn't putting AI content on the site It's much more behind the scenes helping you with efficiency helping you get stuff done but without if if you're a maybe a financial company or a certain kind of company where you feel that AI is too risky for you right now you can still do a whole bunch of stuff behind the scenes right qa testing of links um adding keywords and metadata in a certain way you know so like all of those things can be done with this um and but not necessarily putting like a new blog post on your site Does that make sense it does We we did however went from what is automate to talking about AI How does that connect at all yeah that's that's a very good point Like both things together So just as an example of um using automation to autotag something that's like use the AI is the thing that actually does the autotagging the it's part of the automation So they're they're both kind of the the same thing But but yeah but just to explain that even for people who are um you know maybe not interested in doing a lot of AI work there's still a lot of things that you can do with automation or automation and AI to really help you you know get get more stuff done and get rid of all the boring parts of your job That is kind of the the goal that we have That's the result No more boring parts I'm good That's Yeah I mean that's that's kind of the goal I know I've talked to some customers where you know somebody spends four hours a week putting tags on images you know yeah the tax let's get rid of all of that stuff and just focus on the the more fun stuff of the job right um so let's talk for just a minute about the automate platform itself And I think for developers they'll very much understand this It's you know it's essentially just the system of APIs and web hooks You always start with a um you start with a trigger which is just a web hook and then you have kind of like steps that go sequentially after that that are just either you know functions or APIs or something like that You can have conditionals you can have um loops of things you can have like multiple steps you can have steps that trigger other steps So you can kind of build these really relatively complex workflows but without a lot of code right so um this is something where again like I said a product manager can build some of these things without necessarily getting into a lot of code For a developer we do have code blocks and you know serverless functions and things like that So you can still do a lot of stuff that looks like code to a developer but for someone like me who isn't a coder um you know there's still a lot of stuff that you can do in here and and actually get a lot of stuff done without having to get into code Yeah And like particularly like internal stuff right like like if you want to work within like the content stack management API you can do that in here versus like also being able to do like external sources right yes Yes Exactly And you know this was started one of the reasons why we built this is a platform This isn't just like a simple tool You can actually have a trigger in a third party that does an API thing in another third party that has an output into another third party None of it actually using content stack specifically Um so it's very much a robust um endtoend platform um that you can it's not necessarily just like you know only you can only do stuff in content stack It is a true like robust system Um but that being said you know it it is something where we do have a lot of features where it's built into the system Um you can do things like and we'll show that today You can actually trigger an automation inside of the editorial interface things like that that make it very very powerful and that makes make it more powerful than just kind of web hooks and APIs alone So um the the very last thing I wanted to say is we kind of were just talking about this before before the call What are some things that we want the developers to understand about the product um the first thing is you know and I'll let you guys talk about this a little bit but just kind of the idea of putting all of your code into one place I know I've heard from other developers that sometimes you know you know that there's a script on some Amazon server somewhere some Lambda function that is adding keywords to something but you're not sure exactly where it is Frank set it up two years ago You don't know Like I had someone saying that they weren't sure what like AWS region it was in um and you know like all of those kind of things it makes it difficult to find this That's a really great thing about this is that it's always in the same place as your website content right so everything can be you can still have like web hooks that go off to other places but it starts here so you can always log in with your SSO You can always see it and have have a starting point of where it is so that you are you have it under control Yeah You don't have to play detective Right Exactly Exactly So when I I use this if I like like you just give this example right our management ASDK or API like I always dread having to code yet another serverless function somewhere that then does something with our management API and does something to another service and then gets some data back and like I'm like okay I'm just going to have to code this write unit test all that blah and now I realized I can actually just do that in an automation and then have it return some data to me So I am now putting all my code into automations that return data to me So there's no real complex code in my front end anymore That's very interesting Yes And I' I've heard that from a couple of developers actually that they after they sort of get used to the automate tool for like rapid prototyping It's like really nice Someone gives you an API and says &amp;quot;Oh like we're going to do a PC for of this vendor or whatever.&amp;quot; You plug it in you see what it does You plug it in you put it over there you and you're like &amp;quot;Oh yeah I can you know do this you know um without having to set up a lot of you know again serverless functions or whatever to make it.&amp;quot; You can just like rapid setup is basically nothing You just go Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Awesome So yeah I think that that's like kind of the the basic intro Is there anything that uh I want to see basically yeah let's go Let's get into some examples Well look we commented on our own stream I love it It's like like magic I can do it again Okay Sorry This is too much I I'll fine It's fine I'm just showing we have the power What's going on let's talk about some fun stuff Let's do some automations Let's set some things up Yeah Yeah So um one one really interesting thing that I want to talk about So first off what we're seeing here is the the automate um kind of entry page and you can set up a bunch of different projects to kind of organize and um you know group together your different automations Um one cool thing about this is that each of these folders has different permissions So you can actually have you know a production folder that only one person has access to because you don't want anybody messing with those keys or whatever And then you have another one that has all of your your dev projects in it Um and then when you're ready to go live you can kind of clone it into production set it up and then again nobody can go in there and mess with it So um I think that's kind of a a neat strategy Um and um yeah and then essentially in here we have um just a list of all the different automations in these ca in this case the the new thing that we have launched in um a couple months ago is this concept of ondemand automations and this is where essentially this is the editorial interface I have an automate kind of toolbar over here where I can launch automations while I'm working in the editorial interface And so it used to be that we would set up like workflows that we'd have like a review workflow and a um governance workflow or whatever and those workflow stages might trigger automations which you can still do But this is actually nice because a user can see it on the page and then approve it like with their own eyeballs and look at it and then save it if they're if they're good with any of those changes So I think that that's a really nice paradigm that if you're doing any kind of reviewing and editing within content stack that's a nice way to be able to look at those things So you generally have an automation in a sidebar that works on the entry you're dealing with I imagine Yes Exactly Sorry I was just going to say like that's a great like user experience right because then you don't have to switch back and forth You can just have it right there while you're working on your content Yep Exactly Exactly And the the one really cool thing that we actually have a a feature where it will write to and I actually I'm not sure how to explain this um but it's like writing to the user session or the the draft of the user's page right so it will um it will you can you can see it change and then you will say like um then you read it and then you can save it right so it's not actually ch making a version of it that's saved you're actually able to do it like as a draft update on the page and then you can save it So which is again another feature that I I really like because people again want to have that kind of review It's just like they did it but just a lot faster Yeah exactly So um so I I wanted to kind of explain one really quick thing Um and I think that and I was I'll just show this It's a little bit different than your uh than your order Lo So I just want to show this very quickly Oh that's all good We always go rogue We're good Yeah I'm going a little rogue I'm going a little rogue Makes it spontaneous and fun Yeah Yeah Or a nightmare but we'll see We'll see No we're good We're good Yeah this is just something that I've been just really excited about where there especially with um ChatGpt has this Gemini has it sort of a lot of the newer LLMs have this capability of they call it structured output mode where it will write in compliant a specific compliant JSON schema that you define Right so let me show you really quickly what that's like and then why we kind of like that So I'm going to turn this off really quick so we can kind of edit it But now so you can see here the very first thing in the list is my trigger So in this case my trigger is the the sidebar So this is going to be a user triggered this event right i see And over here we can have this is where I'm kind of defining what kind of event this is Um one thing that we when we very first launched this capability of having the user kind of click to start the automation the very first thing we wanted to do was to be able to gather information from the user at the point of them invoking that trigger So this is kind of an option here where I'm I can build almost a little form to ask them questions about stuff So in this case I'm asking for them to write in basically a command to AI Okay so I'm saying you know what what kind of custom command do you want to give i'm going to collect that information from them and I'm going to send it to AI in the next step Oh cool Okay Okay And so any any kind of thing that they want to ask the um the the AI to do they can just type it into this little box at the point of invocation of the automation Um but just just note here that I can add a number of things as input options here I can add like if I wanted to say you know what's your name right um then I can add either a string a boolean a select field a text area I can have like a little description area here You can have as many of these form fields as you want and that you're basically creating like a little mini form that the user can fill out again at the point of invocation And then you're able to gather that data and pass it to the next steps of the automation And can that automation like the next step can it also get the information from the entry that this was invoked on yes absolutely Any anything that you're doing in terms of so I'm going to delete this um anything that you're doing in terms of uh you know building these automations you can always like click and see all of the data and it will actually have the data from all of the previous steps that you can pull into any place in the automation So I'll jump over here This one is the This is kind of the chat GPT interface and you can see like here's where I'm selecting my model of chatgpt Um in here I'm I'm filling out you can have your your system assistant and user fields here Um now for those of you who have worked with you know kind of the LLM APIs um there's a you know a bunch of stuff you need to know how to do in the set the message and set the system and set whatever here It's just a really nice form I don't need to learn any of those APIs I don't need to do any of that stuff It's just a form in here that I can do I can actually do they have this concept of like multi-shot um like prompting to the LLM where I can say here's what the user is asking Here's what the assistant is saying Here's another user asking Now you go like and that's kind of like um training the LLM how to answer the question You can do that Yeah And you can do that really easily in here by just adding additional prompt text So I can say like building context Yeah Yep Exactly Um so this outputs into one big prompt essentially right that you GPT but it's it's form based so you it's very nice Yes Yes So so again I don't have to learn all of those things but I still have all of those um powerful features available So this is kind of an example also of you know these are some variables that I'm pulling in from other steps in the automation If I wanted to say like um you know let's see I don't know what what I'm going to say but like uh here is the server and then I wanted to tell the LLM something about you know what server it's on or whatever here's a list of all of the different you know the payload from my previous steps that I can pull in just one piece So here's the title right so if I wanted to tell them here's the title of the previous thing I can actually add that in there very easily Um doing it that way Um I will say one thing that sometimes um people you know might get uh confused about is like again what step you're on And you could see in there the the entry sidebar if I'm on this step right then I'm able to see the the two steps above that right if that makes sense Um and so yeah you're able to kind of pull in any of that information So now imagine so again this is my instructions to the AI Imagine if I wanted to do something like you know pull in data from my product database right um or pull in data from Wikipedia or pull in data from my company you know whatever database So I can I can reach out to any APIs pull them into my workflow and then inside of my instructions to chat GPT I can reference pieces of the payload from those different APIs from the external source Yeah Yeah So you put an extra step between one and two now to do an external call basically right yep Exactly So you can add any steps inside of any other steps Um we actually support you can see there's an action step or a conditional or a repeat path So again I can do kind of conditional logic I can do repeat loops without noting any code So yeah So like if in the entry sidebar I set my name you can do a condition on if my name if that name is Tim or Christine or low you can then do another action step here to ask an agent to Google me or to basically just get uh you know a product from Big Commerce or something right yes Exactly IO Yeah Yes Yes Yeah So I mean imagine um I know that we're working with one customer who they want to make sure that they're not duplicating content from another database right so we actually are like cloning over the the database into a vector uh vector database and then we're doing a similarity search between what you're currently working on and what's in that vector database And then we take the the most similar thing from that database and then we compare it to what you're working on just by asking AI here's the thing I'm working on Here's the closest thing from over here Are they the same and then if they are it will um it will say yes they're the same thing or whatever So it's really cool that you can like pull in all of these different steps and things from other places and then just like pull them into AI and ask AI to like do some stuff with it Again you know I'm not a programmer I'm sure that you can do the same thing with without the LLM but it's like super easy just to like put it in and be like &amp;quot;Hey are the are these the same?&amp;quot; You know you don't have to like parse them or whatever programming people do I imagine if you have to do a million of these calls you're not going to use an LLM but if you have to do one a week it's fine Right Right Right Or or even like maybe 20 a day would be fine But yeah I wouldn't do But you're right Like I was joking with somebody the other day that um they said like can we reorder the things in this array and I was like oh yeah I could just send it to chat GPT and just reorder the array And then I was like you know there's probably a better way to do that Yeah Yeah Me too But in general this is like a big time saver Like a lot of the things that you're showing here if you were to custom code this it would take a considerable amount of time right all that extras end to end tests making sure everybody knows about it If like that's what this makes this cool So should we just do one can you just Let's see Well I don't know what this one is This is an AI everything So I'm pretty excited about that Yeah What does this include so this particular one um basically we'll just so we can go to like this um let me just refresh because I don't need to make sure that we're this page So this one I have like you know these are some like Bose head headphones Um so I'll just use a really quick example of that AI anything one where again we kind of saw how this is set up right this is set up where I type in a custom command that custom command is just basically sent to chat GPT with the article right and then again we use that structured data It's kind of like I don't like using the word training but essentially in that in that um setup I showed it the structured data for how to update this page Actually we should show that really quick Yeah I don't think you actually really show a little bit there There just there's basically a part here where you choose what kind of output you want and structured output is a very spec you can see that JSON is one of them but structured output is like a very specific oh yeah you have to stick to this structure and then you add actually you add like a JSON schema here yes so this is based on the content model and it's explaining to the LLM this is essentially what's in my content model and so the LLM would use the API to use this structure to send it some data that it changed ES and therefore your entry will just be updated with data because you send it to the API in the background Right Right And it knows where to put it Yeah Sorry I just was speaking through it to actually understand But luckily you're good Yes You're fine Yeah And so like if I and I think like one of the examples would be like you know like replace um like we'll say the word bose with oops Awesome because they are an awesome company They are So now this is essentially sending this to chat GPT It is like reading all of my text and you can see that on the fly No So think about like what kind of use cases do you have where you have to do like a find and replace and you're copying and pasting into something else back in or are you do you do you ever have to do something where you're like you've got all these like gross like Microsoft tags in there you know like or like um you know what I mean can you actually ask it to remove the Oh okay Christine I have one for you Can you do AI anything again and then ask it to remove the unordered list from the rich text field oh this is going to be a hard one Let's see Oh I want to see this I love that it also changed the slug like the URL too Yeah exactly Oh body copy That's even harder So it's not even saying rich text We're just going to say this Yeah we'll see if it does it or not But yeah So Lo you mentioned that that actually might be something that we don't want it to do Yeah to work No especially if you don't have redirects set in place or anything like that Exactly Yeah The URL don't touch it This is No Did you just see that magic by the way the fact that that worked is Oh it worked That's so cool Yeah And you can ask it to you know like pretty much do whatever kind of text changes that you want to do And it will again it's been trained I don't like saying trained but it's been shown the the schema for this page and now I can just do anything in terms of those types of things So amazing The other thing to clean this up or make it markdown or whatever right yeah Or like would it create a table like did you get it to create a table i have no idea Let's try let's try it I have not tried this before So create a table at the top of the body Copy Yeah But what do we put in the table shows uh some of the the best features of these headphones This is going to be interesting because it's going to [Laughter] Oh my gosh Um um we are responding like this because almost every customer call I'm in they're complaining about rich text because it's just complicated Let's be honest It's not easy It's not that this is a bad product Ratings Did you see how good this is yeah And it added ratings and reviews Yeah I don't know before Is this like fake data or did it actually get it from the rest that's a good question I'm not sure actually Um [Music] but we could build it that it goes to the pimp system fetches that data We can build that one Yes And you know the the other thing I would say too is that um one of the things that I did not I mean obviously we are you know uh we could put into the instructions which I don't I don't believe that I did in this particular case we can say like make sure to only use factual information that was included in the the um the the entry or something the entry of the page right yes And I've done that a couple of times where um uh so another one that we can show a little bit too is basically like a copying and pasting in one where that one I actually asked it to extrapolate based on the content that I'm put So I can put in just a very small amount of content and it will actually like make up stuff and like extrapolate that onto the page In the other direction you can say do not make anything up and only use the headline the subhead the body copy as it pertains to the page Right um so let's try that one really quickly Like so I have let's see So so by the way notice that wasn't saved So right so none of that was actually saved Nice You as the editor get to like look at it with your human eyes and then it exactly if you like it then you can save it Um while you go to the next one Jesse when you're in the chat and you feel like you have a question you want to challenge Christine to see what this AI can do Feel free to put it and we might try just if you have it If not that's fine This is wild It's pretty amazing Yeah this is I didn't expect it I'm still blown away about the table Yeah I'm glad that we So what did you just do Christine what did you just I'm gonna drop this over here I just took like a random page and you can just copy pasted this all of it I copied the whole page Okay And then basically put that into So I have this like smart paste thing I just put that in here right so this is just like a bunch of like blah blah blah blah from the page Um and then it wrote the headline It wrote the Now in this case again it wrote the URL but we can tell it not to do that So you can add instructions Um and then it like wrote this little page here Please go to my blog post Like just go to timbings.dev Grab a blog post and add it Like if that works I'm going to change jobs What are you going to change your job to no longer programming That's for just go to writing on the top Which one do you want let's see Yeah just grab anything just whatever anything with AI Maybe I have to rewrite this now because it's it's actually much more impactful Yeah And then I'll just like use this same page here So um Smart Paste whatever this is Uh oh So headline change the URL The headline the URL Wow This is clean HTML as well And you see it found the category AI when it was published Yeah And it the headings Now imagine though now this particular automation is like literally a three-step automation It's just sending it to AI and writing it back But if you wanted to like like we were saying before pull in Wikipedia pull in the product thing pull in multiple sources doublech checkck the data as you're putting it in You can have like one AI check the other AI and make sure that it you know follows certain guidelines You can pull in your brand kit So brand kit is a a new product where you can kind of establish your voice and your guidelines Pull in brand kit and say does this follow our company you know policies for things Um so all of that can be done at this like cutting and pasting time Um to get rid of the you know like I said get rid of any kind of um uh tags from an external system or something like that um all of those types of things you know you can clean that up rewrite this I mean any of those things you can you can add as part of that So it's it could be very very powerful um in terms of how you want to um how you want to do that Wow Yeah And I really like the way this is built right because AI is great but the more context you can give it the better the more you can work with it as a tool as far as cross referencing itself even sometimes with something else the better the better quality you are going to get in the output and sometimes I think people make the mistake of building out these sort of things and don't allow users to provide enough um context that I I love that point because whether or not they know about it there are a lot of people whoever you are that is watching this right now your organization there are people today who are cutting and pasting things into chat GPT and then pasting it back into whatever into Google Docs into content stack whatever um this is a great way to operationalize AI right so you can actually build an automation that follows your specific rules so again you're not allowed to say like we're you know in the product team at content stack we're not allowed to say innovation So uh you know I can make sure that like nowhere it says innovation in there that and I'm kind of joking by the way You guys both look really serious Like what to be fair I'm a little allergic to the word innovation but that's more because when I work at agency we always did innovation campaigns and it was the most boring  It's borderline like synergy It's a little bit overused Can you do an automation that gives us some synergy yeah Exactly Exactly Yeah but I mean but but yeah so if you have specific rules you can apply those rules as opposed to um you have no control over what people are bringing in from whatever LLMs they're interacting with This way you're operationalizing it and you're able to control it so that it's under your rules and your values Awesome So awesome That is one example So now what we can do is we can show let let me look at your list Um let's do translation Yeah And also I want to Christine point you to this comment and I was kind of going here myself I kind of want to also see what can you actually do with these automations that looks at other data outside of the AI stuff because I think there's kind of a lot of awesomeness there too Yeah Yeah And we can we can I mean if you want we can run through that really quickly here Sure Um if uh Kustoff is okay with that And then we also have this one This is You have an answer to this Are these examples anywhere that we can access yes Yes And and I can show an example of that as well We are going to um we've made all of these recipes So all of the little examples that I'm showing today So they're really good starters in terms of like we have a so we have a translation one auto tagging like some of the fancy AI ones Um this smart paste one Um those are all like examples that when we kind of put together the what do you call it like post show or something like that for for this uh thing then we can include those on the um on that that note and the links to all those as recipes You click on it you get it Yes Yes Exactly And I can show an example of setting up a recipe too if we want to in a couple minutes as well Um but yeah let let me show very quickly Um now I'll use I'll use brand kit as a quick example of pulling something in from an external source just because that's a pretty easy one Um and let's do like we'll just use this one So this is very sim this is I think the same thing or very similar to the the AI anything um one I was showing before But let's say right here So before I go to chat GPT I'm going to pull in code from another platform So I just add another step there I go into my action step menu and then here you can see I have a whole bunch of different um platforms that are already set up Um if I wanted to just find brand kit and you can do a search brand kit and now I have a bunch of actions that are these are basically just endpoints right that are supported In this case I'm going to get a voice profile Oops Not I want to get a single voice profile There we go Actually that's get all And so what you're selecting here for the folks in the chat this can also be another CMS It can be YouTube It can be anything that we connect to It can be another um the output of another automation whatever Yep And so most most of the time you'll have to authenticate So like in this case I'm already authenticated into brandkit but if not I can create a new thing and I can say authorize and then it goes into another page that you can't see and then I you know do my authorization setup and then I'll have like a brand kit number three here or whatever It's like an all setup basically you can do That's good Exactly Exactly Maybe one thing before you move on You can also do any HTTP call here to any API So even like posive ask about a PIM You can definitely pull in and connect to any you can just go to blue stone pim or any URL that you have of like an old school system You can just connect Yep Yep Exactly Exactly Um so in here I'm basically again authenticating to my account Then I'm choosing the um the LLM that I want to use We'll say compass Um this could also be dynamic You can see that in here I'm again have this data from other steps So it might be something where I'm pulling in like the name is based on something that maybe the user set in the very first step or something like that So it could be a dynamic thing Um in this case I'm just going to choose um compass And then I can select the voice profile So here's the different profiles I have And then I can select that Then I can proceed I can test And you can see that it's pulling this up as a test This is the um basically a description of keyword tags that I want to support Um but now when I go into chat GPT I can actually pull in information from that brand kit So I can say um please only use these keywords and then I go and find the here's the single profile Then it'll say like description Then this description is the the variable assigned to the that part of the the payload for um what the description is which has all my keywords in it And then I just added in another So that's an example of pulling data from an external source and then adding that data into your your basically your prompting for chat GPT I kind of love how you showed external data and all that stuff again with all AI things but I know I know we can uh I don't know if there's a like a let's see is there one if you want I can share my screen and show a quick one where it's all code and HTML and craziness if you want Yeah Yeah have obviously like let's see if I can do that me a sec because then cost of we can go deep like we don't have to go too deep but we can definitely like for example this one so oh yeah and like I think um Christine you can talk about the ETL stuff for that also so this one for example this is a very interesting one so I have an external tool that sends a web hook to content stack and so I I asked them to create me something that takes some time and then when they are finished it sends me a web hook and so I actually subscribe to that web hook and well I basically I give them this URL and they call me with this URL So when that comes in I actually do an HTTP if I turn this off I can actually show you that Yeah like I have like a management token here and I you see I query their API using my hen API key that is stored inside content stack and I have a bunch of parameters like I want 50 videos and so well let's see if it shows you the latest Yeah So you see it finds all my latest videos here and so this is just an API call I have no code but then I do want code So in my next step when I get that information in you see I get videos from that result and there's an ID that I actually wanted that was also then sent by that their initial web hook by this one And so with that data I actually have like this is my little serless function that now just runs And so this information I do stuff with it I even console log it And so I kind of just filter their latest 50 videos with the video I want because their API is so crappy that I just have to query the latest 50 again and I cannot just I like I could literally not say oh their success thing just told me what that video is because their web hook sends faster than they actually finished rendering So I like so that's what if that happens if that's a shitty system I put it in here and I fix it And then after that with the information they actually got I query them again to get a specific status to see hey how is that rendering going and then I get all their data and I map it to a data structure that I like for content stack and that then goes it finds a video I already created in content stack based on that information and then it uploads some video like the poster file it uploads the video file it a bunch of things like Then it adds it to another system which is cloudinary which is again code to cloud You see how much you can do Yeah And then I upload keep all your assets there You have a remote access What what am I saying remote assets I couldn't say it for a second I kept saying access This is a really interesting way of literally I am coding actually I'm going data in data out And I like I'm going to show you one that's insane that we're not I'm not going to take the time because this is not me presenting but just give you one that is just ridiculous So I have get all entries that I have in all the taxonomies where I have all these repeat parts with suba automations that then save stuff in data stores and log actions and append data in a data store memory that I have in an automation and then in subautomations I can get that data back and then do something with this and output whatever came out of that data store And so this goes even deeper Kov where you can literally have a memory between all these actions add stuff to it and then in the end grab it and that memory is shared between my sub automations that this is insane Okay I'm done I will say if if I can say very quickly I love the the difference between like my automations are like you know one simple thing and then AI and then and then and yours is like HTTP code block HTTP code block HTTP code This is my serverless function that I would have coded myself Yeah that's the thing right imagine if you had to maintain all that custom code that you did you just did and automate him Yeah And now it's just here like the imagine I don't have any environment variables I don't have any secrets I don't have any all flows I have nothing And so what I can do is Yeah it's just crazy Sorry Christine feel free Please share your screen again and then we go to the nice stuff now because mine was like we're we're burning through time We only have like 15 minutes left It's always like that isn't it and thank you everyone for chiming in and asking questions Please feel free to ask more This is fantastic Yeah in and in regards to the ETL process I mean this is a great um a a great kind of example of you know you can bring stuff in We have some like builtin um capabilities of doing transformations Um so you can have like you you know like there there's specifically a tool that does transformations where you can pull things out of an array find things with an array split add join whatever those types of things Norm normaliz one so I just coded it but I could use that to be fair Exactly So we we do have kind of both ways We have both we have both the the the the developer way as well as you know um the the non-developer way But yeah I was going to say the other way but yeah But yeah I I also wanted to say too one really cool thing just to mention very quickly is we also have something called a um it's called templating So we have like if you're able to build out um it basically uses handlebars if you're familiar with you know handlebars where you can do a very simple templating language So you can kind of like get data out and then loop through it and then kind of create like really great for creating like an email and you send it the email to somebody or um you kind of have like a little modal popup or something like that and you're going to do a little design and like loop through things and then put a variable in there So like those types of things are we have all of the tools to do that as well Um so those are just some nice um nice capabilities to do that So I guess I'll really quickly show um just an example of translation So the thing about translation just very quickly because the the the thing I want to talk about with translation we have been asked by so many customers can we like help them with translation the LLMs are essentially good enough now that enterprises are starting to take notice right um pretty much this entire time it's been you know you really have to set if you wanted to do any kind of machine translation there would be a lot of rules that you have to set I've worked with some customers where they had you know 14,000 rules um about instead of this do this Instead of this do this Instead of this do this When it comes down to it for an LLM you just say don't translate our product names Yeah You don't have to have 14 a list of 14,000 of them It knows them It knows what the entities are It knows people versus products versus it knows all of those things So a lot of times when again when we're working with these companies they had like really complicated um translation rules and they can very much be simplified with just the the power of AI basically Um so just very quickly so one example that we can do is and again you can use brand kit for this you can use something else for this as well but like I did a um let me do this one let's see well we'll just pretend like this one you can just basically come in here and say like um just set your rules for what you want to do in terms of translation This is about keywords for now but you know you can say like do not translate these words do not translate people's names do not but do translate recipe ingredients or whatever right okay So you can kind of just be specific about your names And then again um those are just pulled into the prompting and then we're sending that to AI Now one thing that was really difficult about translations is that you want to make sure that you're getting essentially all of the data on the page but not some data Like you you might not want to to translate your taxonomy terms or your URL like we saw So so you can actually kind of um leave those out or disqualify those from the automation Um and essentially you know so this is kind of an example where again this is triggering from the user I'm bringing in my brand voice which in this case is basically my translation rules Um in this case I'm getting the content model of um whatever the page is that I'm trying to transform And then what we did is we actually built a special connector that handles the basically it takes the the JSON of the entry which a lot of times is really really big like people have like 42 nested blocks and there's like you know so many things in there and like all this stuff and that page ends up being bigger than the context window on a lot of LLMs Oh yeah So we were actually getting a lot of like pages that were too big So what we do is we take the JSON object we pull out all the strings We chunk those into chunks of content We send the small chunks through to the AI and ask it to translate each piece Then we put it back together and then we rehydrate the the JSON entry Yes Because the context window for Brand Kit itself is like a thousand characters only or something right so it it it has like basically it adds up to 4,000 which is the or like GPT4 is the base context window for GPT4 Most of the LLMs are much bigger now You know uh Gemini is like 2 million So as they get bigger we're going to be able to kind of release some of those restrictions but taking past whole code bases basically Yes Exactly Exactly But the the problem is is that when you do send too much data to the LLM it fails very not gracefully It just I've noticed I've noticed I think it confuses it Yeah So we had to build in Yes So we had to build in kind of our own protection because it was a really bad user uh you know interface So that being said um so this is something that again you know we've got customers that pay multiple millions of dollars per year in translation costs and you know if um and and I will say this also I personally and I am the most pro- AAI person um I would not translate my front page with AI right like it's really good and it's really good at human translation and or it's better than human translation in a lot of cases but I would still want a human if it was my front page if it was my main new product page I would really want to you know if in in the 3% of time where it makes a mistake I don't want that mistake on my front page Right Right So um so I I still think that you can look at your low value pages look at your archives look at whatever and and if you're spending you know again $500,000 transforming your archives and doing translations for Germany and these other places maybe this is something for those like lower traffic pages where you can um save a lot of money in terms of doing that But I would still look at you know some kind of a human translation or um you know a vendor for that for the front page Um and then you know obviously you can see how it goes And if if you if you do a thousand translations and you never see a mistake then maybe you're fine But um but yeah I would still be careful Yeah And that makes sense in terms of right like this can help you like you said with those lower value pages so that you can concentrate on not just translation of your higher value real estate right and you can also spend time on localizing it right because it's not just translation sometimes you need to also translate or localize for cultural things right exactly exactly what I like about this is that we're not actually building a product to translate we're just giving you a platform So you can actually build the translation yourself Exactly It just worked This is pretty cool So what do you you speak French right so is this like what do you think of the French uh yeah it's okay But you know what I mean it's cool but this is the problem French like as an example many languages have this They have like four or five layers from street language to politics to doctor language to This is like localization versus translation Yeah Yeah And so how do you judge what your tone has to be well you can probably tell the AI what the tone needs to be right yeah I was just going to say like um I I can't remember what we were but if we said um you know you can again create a brand voice and then in here whatever the tone is that you want either you want it to be more informal you want it to be whatever in addition to specific rules again like um if you say you know my name or my the name of my blog or whatever don't translate that but we can add all of those rules into the brand kit and that becomes part of the and I've I've done this for my own stuff where I make video scripts for my own videos and I use brand kit for that with an automation obviously And so I have told in my prom specifically grab like I gave it like three hours of me speaking but written out as the base um as the knowledge fault basically and then I have also written out Tim uses stop words like awesome and like and because I'm a 90s kid right so those kind of things well born in the 80s speak like the 90s and so I've actually written out exactly how I speak to brandkit And I also tell it just give me two paragraphs nothing more because I don't really want to speak longer in these videos It is spot on me Like it's it's like really cool And I also think like this highlights like a you know there's there is sort of a due diligence and governance piece of AI right like even if you use automate to do some translations you should always go back and look at it And so that's sort of that thing You can use this as a framework or you know a draft but then you still look over it like remember this is a tool but it's also human controlled You got to put some human power in there too And and that's what we were just talking about is that there's again probably people who are doing copying and pasting into Tat GBT writing please translate this into French and then copying and pasting it back into the localization and then they're missing all of that nuanced layer that we can add in there as part of that governance of how you want your language to be in these other in these other areas right so like that's something that that you can add a little bit of control over Whereas you know if you're just asking someone to just paste in some French stuff um it may or may not be in your tone of voice or your brand voice um when you when you add that in Yeah this is good fun We have six minutes What can we show in six minutes yeah Do we have questions well we we had a bunch but we answered a lot of them I don't know if we want Did we touch on the ETL process i don't think so But let's put this one on again Yeah Yeah So so that's definitely something that um again in terms of bringing in the data you can imagine and I can we can kind of show just very quickly Um I'll show the the let's see So again I'll just take this one as an example Um and we actually have a uh transform tool And here's a whole bunch of different kind of transformation properties that you can run So again you can imagine um getting you know getting data from your your PIM and then you're going to get rid of this data and then add this data and normalize it into you know and you can add in all of these things Um or it can be a code block like we saw with with Tim's example Um but yeah there's a lot of these things where you can you know very easily just add in some of these things Here's the template tool that I was mentioning before where this is where you can build out those kind of handlebars um you know code block things where you can kind of again loop through those very easily and add things in there So um but yeah but that that's a that's a great example of like bringing in things together I'll show one more thing Um the so I think what Kustoff kind of means here is also how does the caching work on RCDN for the data that comes in Can we tell them to refresh something specifically yeah I mean if there's a an action like an end point right so for example launch launch has end points where we can actually like we'll show because we might actually be able to just send a header to just like invalidate this cache thing or something right and get it to go over call again Yeah Yeah If we do I don't know if I have a because I know we have like read right oh yeah So this has a specific action even but I think where KF is coming from where this is the world I live in API orchestration right I'm going to grab five things and make one output just for my website what happens if one of those five updates and my API call still looks the same right so do we have controls on let's say if something updates there are we going to just have a TTL for example of 60 seconds how can we control that somehow and the thing is this product is not yet a full API orchestrator right so the moment we go there we might want to even on whatever returns on each field there field there figure out a TTL or we can do a TTL on the implementation side of the action So because of we're kind of still looking at that because we have all the DNA to literally build like the best API or try to put it together Yeah the catch is always the story right we know this and all of this we can just maybe we even cach it on the CDN edge or we put it in fastly and how do we kind of like purge cache on certain systems This is Oh so you're going to show some some cool stuff now that is not actually released but I like it This is we're getting an exclusive unplanned but yeah and this is this is still in our dev uh kind of experimental things but yeah so we do have yeah so this is on dev this is on dev currently this is on dev currently we have to we have to kind of figure out um is this the is this do we have everything that this is going to do what we need it to do but pretty much for what you're describing where you're bringing in a bunch of data from different places So you can do the same action steps and all that stuff like we were showing before and then as part of that you know add everything to your to your body set your TTLs here and then your response is the uniformed um you know tied together response of all of those things together in the way that you want and then it responds with that on your Yeah So all the stuff I custom build is basically just nicely handled within the product when this comes out Yeah which is I I literally cannot wait for that And if you guys if anyone's super interested in this please please let us know We'd be interested in kind of like a proof of concept beta test to make sure that this does sort of what you're what you're needing to do But it's something that again we're we're kind of beta testing this right now Yeah And this is potentially a huge product update if we can also do that part I will say also just as a I wasn't going to talk about this but this is something also that um is one coming someday which is you know agents and agentic workflows in um in AI that's just automations It's just automations but the AI gets to choose the ordering of it Um so when when we add in aentic workflows with automations it's really really cool So we won't get to that right now but coming soon I'm so sad to say we are out of time Oh yes Exactly Yes Um but this was fantastic Um please everyone if you joined in today or if you're looking at a recording feel free to join the community You can talk about and ask us any questions We will always respond Um if you want to take a look at the recipes or get further information it'll all be in the community Awesome Thank you so much Christine It was so much fun Yes I wish we' had more time Have you ever seen where you had two developers almost fall off their chairs when you just add a table in a rich text like I say I'm so glad that worked because I had no idea Yes it was amazing Pure magic Awesome Thank you guys so much I appreciate your time Cheers everyone Bye All right Bye Take care everyone"
