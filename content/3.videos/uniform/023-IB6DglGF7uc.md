transcript: this is tim from uniform and in this video i want to show you that we just released a really cool integration with clearbit which is a company that gives you really valuable information about your users and where they work and all of that kind of stuff and we've integrated with them so you can actually personalize for people that have opted in for this type of data sharing so you can see here on my screen that i have a clear bit integration and when i go to our personalization tab you can actually go to quirks and you can see that a whole bunch of variables from clearbit came in and you can see the integration is here and so you have company name sector things like that and i'm actually going to be using in this demo our company employee range because what i want to be doing is add a signal um if a user does specific things a signal is triggered in our personalization about conference speaking because i love speaking at conferences and nowadays that is also pre-recording or how do you use your audio things like that and so i want to kind of advertise the fact that i like conference speaking and recording and video and audio and if people do certain actions on my website and they fit an employee range that clearbid gave me i want to show them personalized content about conferences and that will probably give me a bit better conversion for these people that are interested about my conference related stuff and so i made a conference speaking interest signal and what i did i used one of these quirks to clear bit which is the company employee range has to be from 5 to 10k because i always want big companies to have me speak in real life i don't really care but for this demo this is the perfect one quirk can also be like a guip location or they're basically key values that you get on the base of your page load and then personalize against them so in this case you work at this company from five to ten k people and there's a group here you either went to the speaking page because you went to my website you're interested in my speaking you click on it or you clicked on a link that i shared that had the utm campaign query string that says conference because i might be sharing stuff on linkedin about me speaking when people click that it's a very specific signal that they're interested in that okay so now we have this setup let's do some content editing so in canvas which is our content editing part let's change up my home page based on this personalization and so i have set up my homepage with a whole bunch of things like there's a hero there's video highlights of me a two column component about what i do at uniform and my latest talks and latest blog posts and it looks like this so let's go to preview here for a sec there you go hero highlighted videos two column component and so how about we personalize first my highlighted videos right right now they're just the latest three that i made but if you're interested in speaking what i want to show you here is videos about speaking recording audio things like that and when you're really interested i'm also going to change this one so when you went to the speaking page a couple of times or you have a stronger signal i want to show this one changing as well okay before we start doing that i'll show you a bit of the tooling we use to make this much easier so we have a chrome extension where you can basically see all the personalization rules that are on your website and currently we have one that is inactive because we haven't personalized anything and it's the conference speaking interest and the quirk that we were talking about is here right the 5 to 10k people like i work at a company with that range i've set that up already and currently with clearbid i don't work at a company like that so what i've done i made a little button here to kind of fake it until you make it but because of that there's the quirk it's been set it's a clear bit variable right so let's personalize how about let's start with these video highlights and just click personalize this and so this will be a video personalization and i want to show one variation and so this is my default variation with default videos but let's add one that's more personalized so video highlights i want it to be dark and i want it to be called videos for you because now it's personalized for the user right everything about conferences and recording hopefully without the typo next time anyways let's add the first video about conference stuff and it needs to be big uh conference um i know this is one of my conference talks so let's put that in and let's also add some other ones um i know that yeah there's a vlog of me going to a conference and what my experience was and let's also add something about my audio setup or something yeah there we go okay so now let's say i want to see this one when i personalize and this one when i don't personalize so here we're going to add a criteria that says if my conference speaking interest is the same or higher than 50 points and you're scoring points by doing actions on the website and when you reach a certain threshold this stuff is shown so let's preview that again so now we actually already see it that's interesting let's have a look at my settings oh look at that it was probably set from before so let's clear them all and now we see the defaults right so we need to set that quark i work at this company and now you can see that there's something inactive but the quark is set okay let's now go to the speakers page go back home and there it changed and so basically when you now look here you can see that we scored a little bit of points 50 because i clicked on that link once right and so now when i go again and go back nothing has changed because we didn't set it up but you can see there's now 100 points so let's go back to the default and also personalize another part right because we have this two column component here and if you're really interested i actually want to show you an image of me presenting and maybe two or three components about me being like a master of ceremonies for your company or maybe something about my press kit because i have images and some biographic related stuff for you to show so let's do two column component this one and personalize it and this will be i don't know about me personalization if we choose one and here we go two column components and it will be small on the left and the title will be oh let's let's not do a title let's just give it a background and on the left side let's do an image and let's make that image me speaking at a conference and then we have to add some rich text right and that comes from the cms as well about me being an mc and let's add another one about me doing press kit okay now we have to set the criteria to speaking interest but in this case let's make it over a hundred so you have to be really interested so we've set all this now and let's go back to the preview let's make sure that we have nothing set up so the quirk is not there and it's inactive so let's set our clear bit value we go to speaker we go back so video has now changed but this one didn't because we only have 50 points let's go again and come back and now this has changed because i have more points and this is kind of how you can shape all of this and currently i only used my cms to kind of change this up and so what we can also do is go to other sources to personalize as well right because what if i want to show some products for me teaching you about video recording and things like that well let's do that quickly so we set up some products and this is just the default one right so here this is big commerce this is yet another source we have integrated with let's just give you some default stuff here let's save and let's have a look how that looks okay these are just two products but now let's personalize just for products and so this is the default and let's add another one that is this and these are products for you and here let's do something different about video related stuff like a webinar how to build your brand tips and tricks for recording perfect and then we can say okay add some criteria and this one is also pretty strong you're gonna have to really want to see this okay let's save well let's see what our score is well it's already high enough apparently yeah we have 100 so that's where that is so when i now actually clear everything you see you go back do nothing well let's set our clear bit value now we go to speaker one time this has changed let's go again come back we now have different products and a different paragraph and this is now done at javascript level on hydration of the page but you can also do this on the cd8 so you don't even need javascript to have dynamic personalization this is what i wanted to show you today and i hoped it worked out well for you i hope this made sense and feel free to ask me anything about it and i'll see you next time cheers
