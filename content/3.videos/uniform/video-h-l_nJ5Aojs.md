title: "Uniform MACHathon 2022 - Rage against MACHine's project demo"
description: "Uniform won the Maturity award and the Audience Choice award at this year's MACHathon! The winning project from Rage against the MACHine was a composable accelerator for commerce sites. This video is a demo of how it works (and a bit about how we made it work). Here's why we built it: to allow businesses to spin up actually useable eCommerce websites with the click of one button. But how was it made? And why is it important that it was built with composability in mind and a MACH architecture? You can find out these and more details in the blog post we wrote on the subject: https://uniform.to/uniform-wins-MACH-awards"
