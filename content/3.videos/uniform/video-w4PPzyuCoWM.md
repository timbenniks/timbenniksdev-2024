title: "MACHathon 2022 entry Rage Against the MACHine"
description: "In today’s digital landscape, data-driven experimentation has become the lynchpin of growth strategies. “Build, test, tear down and repeat” has become a mantra for businesses focused on product-led growth and customer acquisition loops. With a composable architecture based on MACH principles, businesses have the essential pieces in place to apply growth principles to the very brands they put in front of customers.\n\nBy both removing the technical barriers that slow down the launch of a consistent, repeatable stack and adopting an architecture that allows for an ultra-flexible approach to front-end component design, forward-thinking companies can hyper-target sub-brands, audience segments, global regions, verticals, or product categories - without starting from scratch every time a new site needs to be built. While much of the content may be the same as the master brand site, companies can build a site to support a specific play, test its performance with the target audience, tear it down and repeat.\n\nScaffolding composable stacks need to be more accessible to all stakeholders and not just a tech team.\n\nWhat it does\n\nFor our MACHathon Accelerate entry, team \"Rage against the MACHine\" has collaborated to deliver a next-gen MVP for a “composable commerce stack accelerator” based on Uniform experience orchestration, a BigCommerce headless commerce, and Contentstack headless CMS. This software offers the ability to scaffold new stacks easily as a business user, test performance, tear them down, then repeat."
