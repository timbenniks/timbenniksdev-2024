description: "See more at: https://uniform.to/zzkFwx\n\nIn recent years we've seen a lot of change in how enterprises use digital experiences to drive customer engagement and e-commerce.\n\nAlong with an explosion of infrastructure and tech stack options, decoupling from monolithic suites has offered more flexibility than ever.\n\nBut, traversing the headless landscape and orchestrating it into a cohesive architecture can present challenges, particularly as the number of business-critical tools behind great experiences continues to change and grow over time.\n\nToo often, that means that businesses need more and more developer expertise to tell their stories. And this at a time when developers are in short supply.\n\nContent editors and marketers are left struggling to keep up and frustrated by a lack of control they may have enjoyed with traditional suites.\n\nThat's why we're excited to announce Uniform, the worldâ€™s first truly composable DXP.\nAs a frictionless, composable digital experience platform, Uniform gives companies the power of choice to continuously adopt new tech without ever re-platforming.\n\nFront and center is the power of choice. Choose your own headless sources, your own tech stack and your own hosting. You can connect CMS, CRM and Commerce platforms with ease.\n\nUniform is completely opinion-less and therefore offers true composability. Not one integration is the center of the universe and all parts are equal. It acts as a platform to orchestrate both traditional and headless sources without telling marketers or developers what to do. Yes, you can even treat select monolithic systems like Sitecore as a headless source in Uniform.\n\nAnd with Uniform Canvas, you get powerful no-code tools to allow marketers to retain control over composition, personalization, A/B testing and managing brand experiences without developer support.\n\nUniform Canvas allows business users to seamlessly create engaging experiences based on a multitude of headless and legacy sources without concern for which systems that data is coming from, with instant preview allowing them to understand how changes impact a finished experience. Even when their tech stack changes over time.\n\nUniform ensures your team can continue to deliver incredible experiences as your architecture evolves. After all, change is the only constant. Super fast site performance, enterprise-grade security and great Core Web Vitals is only the beginning. Start telling your story now with Uniform."
