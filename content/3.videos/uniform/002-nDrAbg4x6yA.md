transcript: this is Tim from uniform and in this video we will talk about the uniforms redirect management [Applause] [Music] and before I show you let's talk a little bit about why this is so important because redirects are vital for especially marketers also for when you maybe relocate certain pages and you don't want your SEO to break and so generally redirects are a technical issue right they're always in the backlog of some developer that actually has to add a rule to a Json file or maybe update a database or actually code a redirect in the router of their application and it's just a challenge because marketers might need to change a redirect rule tomorrow because another partner has some certain URL set up or something SEO is not correct marketers need redirects and if they are not correct you will lose money and you will lose time and so especially in a composable architecture where everything is everywhere and it's really abstract uniform helps you by creating the project map where all your URLs are and all your compositions and then also on top hit added redirects and so you can visually see where Pages go so let's go into the browser here and I'll show you how it works so this is our site map for the project in our project map and you can see there's a Java drip specialty coffee maker here and let's say this is such a special project or product that I want a vanity URL for it so what we can do is actually go to our redirects and say let's add a new redirect gold felony Imagine This Is Christmas campaign special product whatever right and so what you can do is actually select just the source URL that you want to exist and then select our Target and we are good to go and we have now officially added a redirect that is actually a 301 header it's important for Google and when you hit save now this just works throughout the uniform SDK there is a little bit more you can do so if you actually hit edit here you can click on the advanced Tab and you can see you can actually map one product node or one project map node to another if you wanted to and we can also say you know what any query string that is added to this hero like UTM campaign or UTM Source or whatever is actually added to the request to the redirect and then we can actually say you know what kind of header do we need here and this gives you just that little extra um stuff that you need maybe as a developer to set this up for people and this makes it a very rich and easy to use interface and what you should know as a developer you can actually use uniform CLI and apis to do this as well so you're not bound to this interface you can actually use it problematically so there's one other um awesome feature I want to show you that makes things a lot simpler so when you go back to the project map and you see that here in the shop that lives at slash shop here there's a product that is dynamic so this could be a thousand product URLs any different URL parameter loads a different product into this composition and then we still have our vanity URL here that's and this one doesn't show the vanity URL but it does show that it redirects there's a little icon here so let's say shop needs to become store because we need to move some things around well to make sure that the SEO is still good and actually your app redirects everything let's just do store here and then uniform detects oh there may be some redirects needed well let's do that let's have these three nodes actually redirect now so when I hit save um you can see that all of them now have a little icon and so let's go to redirect and have a look what happened so the shop that goes to all these product pages with little Asterix here now goes to store with a 301. and the interesting thing is that even our shop javascripts like the vanity URL that we created is now also going to store so uniform has kind of understood all the things you had and if it was already affected and we added a whole new rule for a bunch of pages it still makes that work you can see that the system actually creates these for you and so again you can also do this with the API or the CLI and you can extract all those and put those in your first l.json or put them on Akamai or whatever you need to do these things and so that's all I wanted to show you and I think this is a great tool for marketers to be able to safely redirect keep canonical URLs in place make sure the correct HTTP headers are set up even if these marketers might not understand what these headers do this means developers are still happy so this actually enforces the visual workspace of uniform that you use as your full team rather than just a marketer or just a developer alright um happy website building cheers [Music]
