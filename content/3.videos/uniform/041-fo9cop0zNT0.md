title: "True composability in the modern DXP"
description: "In this video we will discuss what true #composability is in the context of #DXP.\nNowadays, business leaders and developers are demanding freedom of choice across the board. And this puts traditional suite vendors in a state of chaos.They are trying to change the way they work while still staying mindful of the past 10 years of marketing the \"suite\" approach.\n\nThey are literally buying companies to try to create the feeling of composability while in fact they are only allowing you to compose with the components in their suite offering. You can't coin a term like composable DXP if you do not offer real flexibility.\n\nCustomers will still suffer from vendor lock-in, complex upgrade roadmaps and lot's of work to customize anything in the system. We've seen a huge explosion in digital experience tools over the past ten years, and the market is only moving faster. The tools you have today won't be the same tools you're using in 6 months time, or 2 years' time.\n\nTrue composability is the #powerofchoice in EVERYTHING. From Tech stack to hosting, CMS, media management, marketing tools, CDN, analytics, whatever.\n\nWe need an opinion-less platform in which nobody is the centre of the universe. A platform where all elements are equal and that offers flexibility and extendability whenever needed. Never re-platform again. Just switch out integrations.\n\nA truly composable DXP offers Freedom of choice in everything but with painkillers for orchestration and content composing."
