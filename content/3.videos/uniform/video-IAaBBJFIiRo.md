title: "The problem of modern DXP (and the solution)"
description: "The modern DXP is a group of headless tools connected to each other. This arrangement leaves content editors and marketers frustrated as they need to ask developers to connect services together to create a simple page.\n\nHow do we solve this? We need a low-code or no-code platform that allows content editors to easily compose pages from different headless sources with minimal developer involvement, But at the same time, developers need to love working with this platform, they need the flexibility and the #powerofchoice to choose their tech stack and anything else in the front-end."
