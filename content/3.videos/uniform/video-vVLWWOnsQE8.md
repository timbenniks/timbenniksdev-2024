title: "New features for Contentful in Uniform Canvas"
description: "Uniform is excited about some new features for Contentful headless CMS users - check out this video to see these in action:\n\nMulti-space support\nContentful customers can now connect Uniform components to any space (or environment) in their account. This means that once developers wire up components to various spaces, business users can easily use our no-code editor to build experiences without needing to understand where content is coming from. The final page will present *ahem* a Uniform experience for end users. Of course, you can run A/B tests and personalization on every component too. And a bonus - this works at the environment level too, so components can even pull from specific space environments.\nRead the documentation here: https://docs.uniform.app/canvas/tutorials/add-contentful/#connecting-to-multiple-contentful-spaces\n\nIntroducing patterns\nBuilding digital experiences at scale can be repetitive and eat up development time. Weâ€™ve added patterns - a way to share a component (which could also contain other components) between multiple compositions. For example, you could use a pattern to share a legal disclaimer, news release author bio, or standard global header across many compositions. These can also be revised once added to a composition, so developers can accelerate build times when designing large sites.\nRead the documentation here: https://docs.uniform.app/canvas/tutorials/patterns\n\nLocalization for global marketing and ecommerce\nUniform components and compositions can now be localized. In addition to localizing content inside Contentful, users can now localize front-end components inside Uniform - giving users more flexibility when it comes to adopting a localization strategy. Both devs and business users get full flexibility with the ability to localize at any level - composition, component, and content."
