title: "Nuxt 3 with Content v2 and Uniform is magic"
description: "This is an alternative approach to using Markdown files with Nuxt 3 and the Nuxt Content module. Uniform allows developers and content editors to compose with different sources. Markdown is one of these sources. Want to do a POC of a personal site, but you don't want a CMS and the hassle of content modeling and an account? This is a great way to use your own tooling but still show off the composability approach of a modern stack.\n\nhttps://content.nuxtjs.org\nhttps://docs.uniform.app\n\nhttps://uniform.to/discord"
