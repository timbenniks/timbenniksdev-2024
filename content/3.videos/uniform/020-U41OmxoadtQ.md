title: "Setting up live preview with Uniform and Nuxt 3"
description: "Uniform Canvas live preview has been built into the Uniform Nuxt module and utilizes Nuxt's native preview functionality. This video shows you how to set it up.\n\nWant to get started with Nuxt 3 and Uniform? \nhttps://uniform.dev/blogs/uniforms-latest-sdk-fully-supports-vue-3-and-nuxt-3\n\nDocs: https://docs.uniform.app/guides/composition/live-preview#nuxt-3\nGet a free account: https://uniform.dev/free\nJoin our Discord: https://uniform.to/discord\n\nMore info:\nWe are excited to announce that the Uniform SDK is ready for Vue 3 and Nuxt 3. Today's ever-expanding landscape of headless products demands that developers somehow connect them all. Wouldn't it be cool if you had one SDK that takes care of connecting up these different APIs? Uniform is a new category of product. It lets you take control of your stack, so creating composable architecture becomes a breeze! \n\nIt enables content editors to drag and drop content from headless sources to create page compositions. Without the help of developers, they can add or remove integrations, do an A/B test or personalize across multiple headless products. Want to change up your CMS? The front end stays the same. You can retrieve a page composition through an SDK function, query, and map data as you prefer, and pass it as props to your components. It works with SSG, SSR, Edge functions, and everything in between."
