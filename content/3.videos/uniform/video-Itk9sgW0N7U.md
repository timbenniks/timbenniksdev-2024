description: "Uniform for Sitecore helps Sitecore customers to achieve the performance, scalability, cost and security benefits of the modern web without requiring expensive, risk and time-consuming upgrades.\n\nUniform for Sitecore offers two capabilities: Deploy and Optimize. These capabilities can be used separately or together.\n\nNew features for Uniform For Sitecore:\n* Edge-based personalization and decoupled tracking is available in Uniform Optimize.\n* Fully integrated incremental cache purge for Akamai (using Fast Purge) into the Sitecore publishing process.\n* Fully integrated incremental cache purge for Cloudflare into the Sitecore publishing process.\n\nImprovements:\n* Support for Sitecore JSS 16.\n* Ability to configure warnings that are shown to content authors when they try to make changes that once published will trigger full site redeployment.\n* New re-sync page and check page data buttons are added to facilitate in development and troubleshooting.\n* Item-based configuration has 'enabled' checkbox for temporary disabling services that were configured either via the item-configuration or even file-based config.\n* npm package dependencies updated across the board.\n* Improved content and media sync performance.\n* \"none\" publish target is now different from \"fake\" (\"none\" used to be an alias for \"fake\") and throws exceptions to remind that publish target needs to be configured.\n\nhttps://docs.uniform.dev/sitecore/\nhttps://uniform.dev/sign-up\nhttps://twitter.com/timbenniks"
