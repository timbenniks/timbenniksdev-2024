transcript: hello everyone and welcome back to yet another product meetup and we are getting the question quite often on how can i personalize based on a location of a user and it's actually a really valid question because it happens all the time and now in this video tony will show you how we can do a go ip localization get the data push it into our personalization engine and then use that data in the cms to select the right content for that personalization are you ready to rock tony let's go yeah let's show this stuff here we go all right so what do we have here we have a free service called free um and when i interact with it it gives me back a json output what i'm interested in is a country code right there that you can see on line two so this is what we will be acting on when we're personalizing our content so currently i have vpn set up on another screen so i'm going to be switching it as i'm demonstrating stuff so this is a well-known conference site that we use all the time i'm going to go ahead and clear everything and refresh this page what's going to happen is that as you can see there's a little flash and that's purposely done because we're making a call to free of the free service getting the country code back and pushing it inside of our tracker as an enrichment and as you can see here is a country code then also gives us some points and then we're personalizing content based on that okay so i'm gonna that's awesome because this actually is not something we integrated as a specific signal that's guip but it's actually getting third party data with some query and pushing it into our tracker like some sort of plug-in right uh correct yeah and so with that in mind you could also do that with with different systems and that makes it like super extensible yeah cool yeah you can easily integrate a cdp any other api service that provides you any data that you would like to push it back into tracker and then personalize based on that that can be easily done so i just went in my vpn and i'm all moved over to europe so as you saw that that's so very french i like it so now we are pushing another country code and so we have now score against france and then based on that id or the fact that it's french we're now showing a different piece of content from the cms based on that information right correct correct so with all of this what you can see is how easily uh you can interact with the external systems but you might say but how does my content authors act on that info and how can they even tag this content because obviously this specific how do you say this tim do you speak english exactly so how how would i tag this content with a french country code so let's go over to cms we're using content stack in our scenario here let's have a look at how we actually tag this information yeah so we have to provide content with with an intent in our regular scenario right as we are populating our cms with intents and signals from uniform here we're using enrichment as you can see i have a content that has an enrichment tag add to it country fr and that's it so that's as easy as it is and there's different countries that are available for me to tag my content with if i don't know made like sorry man so but i'm just excited that's why if you now made another content piece and tagged it with let's say russia and you would change your vpn you would actually see that content piece right yep let's go ahead and do that i'll go to my personalized hero and let's add a new new entry yeah and hero entry there you go and then let's just say hello russia description will be the same same button text same everything same and then intent tag let's go ahead and create it oh yeah we need a russian intent tag there of course or an enrichment in this case right in richmond yeah in richmond so we're gonna go to here settings and enrichments and we're just going to add a value and call it ru save it that's it we have it you might need to publish yeah and then i'll have to publish from canton stack as well but i only have one problem i don't think there's a vpn in russia oh no that's my mistake so we couldn't actually solve that one let's see russia i don't have a vpn in russia but i have ukraine ah let's do a ukraine one yeah and i already created ukrainian version let me just show you as you can see we've got ua here it is yep right here and then content uh let's just this we'll just don't save this uh let's see right here oh but there is actually a ukrainian version already yep so and then i have it oh yeah there it is yeah so let's go ahead and go to ukraine a few moments later okay we just we're connected continue from here all right so we now uh were able to connect to ukraine let's go ahead and see what happens here yeah there it is it's really cool and so that's just doing an ajax call to a third party service pushing it into the tracker and run and it works um short but sweet but this is really cool and i think lots of people have asked and so the most interesting interesting part for me is that we didn't actually have to integrate something in our product you can just use its extensibility to get here and that's what tony just showed us so that's really cool man thanks again any worse thoughts on this tips and tricks no just uh what all i want to say is that our platform is fully decoupled and that's why i was able to build this quick proof concept in i don't know less than an hour so you can do the same and you can integrate with your systems with cdp's with ip services your internal services just be free and do what you like to do with your site awesome thanks for f for watching everyone and i'll see you next time cheers
