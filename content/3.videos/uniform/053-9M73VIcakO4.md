transcript: hello tony how are you this friday hello tim i am great and i am ready for the weekend ready to rock and roll um this is a nice about a friday show right we get to hang back and relax on fridays and just talk about our week and talk about some gemstech stuff so are you ready for some news let's go or write it in this is gemstack friday with tnt [Music] [Music] alright we got some interesting news that came out this past two weeks starting with the first one is cloudflare pages is now general availability so what is cloudflare pages cloudflare pages think of them as offering by cloudflare something like netfly or versailles where you can build a really fast static website and deploy them to a a place where you can serve them from so azure has static websites netlify has their own platform versailles has their own platform where devops is all built in with cloudflare pages now you're getting that functionality as well from this specific cdn gatsby image plugin has been updated and it's really interesting that we discussed last week comparison between nexjs and gatsby and we went to the details of image in each one of these frameworks and now we get this guide to all new gatsby image plug-in really interesting i'm curious if uh gatsby team is watching our videos and they have released this uh this interesting breakdown of everything related to this plugin all right moving on tailwinds version 2.1 has been released check it out i really like this css framework if you're new to css i would not recommend starting with tailwinds i would probably recommend going to bootstrap or something well known to everyone but if you have been working with bootstrap for a long time and you want to get started with something more advanced you should definitely give it a try for tailwinds flowing into the next news that we have is storybook 6.2 has been released this is a really great tool for you to store your components in one place and if you have if you're a big enterprise and if you're interested to share your component between your teams and everybody work on it this can be a really nice solution for you netlify has released this new feature now in your account you can go in and select under your account on the right side uh netlify labs enable it and one of the features that they have released is dark mode i'm a fan of dark mode so this was really nice i really like that next uniform dev has went through a little redesign so check it out and let us know what you think something that we always run into when we talk about jam stack sites specifically when we talk about nexjs framework and we talk about security authentication this is a very interesting library that works with nexjs give it a try you don't need to write all of those complex scenarios uh you're logging in logging out registration and so on you can just take advantage of this framework and maybe eventually even extend it give it a try this will take care of your authentication with your nexjs applications and last but not least is the style components so we build these very fast performance sites now with jam stack architecture approach and we would like to add some charts some graphs to our site and because i'm a react kind of i've been with the react now past past few years or diving into the next.js so this library is for react and it has a typescript support so give it a try and add some cool graphics cool charts to your web pages if you like this news if you like what we're sharing with you give it a thumbs up let us know in comments what you think and what kind of news you would like to see more and don't forget to subscribe see you next week thank you tony that was some cool new stuff hey so we talked earlier a little bit about how often we should do this show so so what do you think what would be interesting here i think we should refer to our viewers and you let me know in comments how often you want to see it every two weeks every week and what kind of content you want to see more what would you like us to talk more about what kind of news you're more interested in and you know what maybe it's also the length maybe it should be a 10 minute thing maybe it should be an hour thing anyways we are completely flexible and open to all sorts of comments whatever you want so shall we get into um you know our subject of the day let's do it yeah architecture exactly so today we want to be talking about breaking gem stack architectures and just because some architectures are how everybody thinks they are relatively cliche gemstack stuff but there's actually so much out there and you know tony and i have been going through a couple of use cases and we found some fun stuff to talk about so i think this can be pretty cool so let me just go to the slides and see what we can do i'll be presenting a little bit and tony please break in so we can have some nice conversations on this and feel free to also put some comments in the chat of fun architectures with gemstack that you might know about okay right what do we discuss today gemstack's basics refresher so we're just going to go over gemstack again for everyone to just go back to the basics too so we all know what it is i think most people will know but it can never hurt right to go back to basics sometimes a typical gem stack architecture like what do we know and love about gemstack and what is this base and then let's try to do some more dynamic gemstack project and hopefully inspire you a little bit and we're just gonna keep it conversational and see how we can figure out more dynamic fun stuff with the gem stack so basic refresher are you ready for this tony yep how about this this these here are my photoshop skills so i have this slide for a while now it's it's been in my my collection for a bit so bon mamon is like a famous jam in france and also i guess in the world most people know this thing but of course this is the jam stack one but you can see it's dated because the logo is written with capitals for jam that's no longer true but it's still fit anyways it didn't have the psd file anymore nice photoshop skills yeah anyways so kind of way back in the day when i wrote this this deck it's like gems that created the new paradigm for application architecture if that's true maybe not like tony what kind of um static side generators did you use back in the day creating websites uploading to ftp that was my ah you're one of those manual but uh i think i used like some ruby automated like static side generator i think github pages even used it better yeah first one that i used that really i understood the concept of static sizing was jekyll oh yeah that's what i meant yeah super hard to like first to grasp it to understand what's happening because you had to build out a whole dynamic functionality in there you had to have all your settings stored in one file and then it will during the build time it would pull from different spots and then build it out and this is i guess where headless cms's coming in play and well you know what it was quite an enlightening thing and an enlightened thing back then how these guys built that software but you know so jamstack didn't really create a new paradigm it just created new tools to redo this much easier right it's like jackal 2.0 almost yeah and so let's talk about why we you and me here think that we most likely needed this new paradigm or at least those new tools for static site generator because this is one big ass slide but basically what a lot of those monolithical systems do so the ones that are not jam stack you kind of have like the user that visits the website and then there's this whole chunk with everything inside so we're talking about how wordpress deals with their database their cms services the web server everything is in one chunk right and on its own this is pretty decent but there's also some drawbacks to this um system right and so so tony which systems that i've written down here on the top have you used yourself uh almost everyone uh except api server i used every one of those except for ap yeah i think same for me i've done one episode project maybe but then i also had like umbraco we had hippo there were so many countless cmss but they were good whenever whenever you needed a project they were good and everything was right there especially when i back in the day wordpress i mean installation from a browser all you have to do is set up few configs click next next done i think when i used wordpress it was still ftp so that's been longer ago but after that so you first upload it but then you run through install.php and that's it i was to me that was magic right that php script that would write database configuration files and the dangers of how that would work with a php script and security but anyways it was really working well however there are some drawbacks to these kind of systems and all of those written on on the top they have dealt with certain of those things that are problematic not all but everybody is moving forward right but anyway so what are the issues with these monoliths as we say well i'm just going to go and show all of them there there's quite a bit here right but the main thing that i am generally interested in is performance and i'm not saying wordpress is slow or sidecore is slow they're not they're actually fast but it's really a lot harder to get to high performance on those systems than where on the gemstack side you generally get it out of the box because it's statically generated and you never have to has to you know call an origin server and that's yeah it just by default makes it easier to be faster right yeah and when we talk about performance i want to highlight the lighthouse score right everybody's interested in lighthouse score may 21 2021 coming up yeah that's when google will kick in their new algorithms and i noticed at some point you can do as much improvement as you can in your sites the with these cms systems but there's a ceiling that you hit and that's it you can't improve anymore because yeah they're monolith they're origin based and you're just you can't push it further the only way i have known to solve that is by using a cm or sorry a cdn in front to completely statically render that page but then you've effectively created a static website yeah right so you by default now going towards gemstack in that sense um and by cost i wrote that down because cost generally is that you have to you know you have to buy the license of those big systems okay that's that's the thing you do but it's also hard to maintain price wise right you need let's say you host it on azure you have to all have to have all these azure instances as your database as your search like it's it's kind of a there's a lot of stuff going on for you to host this thing because they have an origin it's always on and yeah for the for even just a wordpress site you have to have like a blog i want to run a blog just to basically push my ideas out there yeah i'll need a database i will need a wordpress instance somewhere running and serving and then the more traffic you get you need to scale out so yeah maybe multiple like content delivery servers and stuff yeah that's uh it will just go up super fast the cost exactly and so actually the next one or security and power consumption they both kind of slot into that right because if you talk about power consumption the more servers and things you have running to get this thing out there to for your public to to see what your ideas are for your wordpress blog it's always on stuff right even if you don't use a certain part of your system it's still on because it's a monolith and this just consumes a bunch of power and on the security end of things there's just more sorry plugins those plug-ins you install marketplaces man you don't update them that's it you get sql injections you yeah i'm a victim of that it happened oh really to my whole server yikes yeah it was bad yeah and like there's just more surface area to attack there's more places in the the chain to be able to hack into because it's run time dynamic right if it's static there's nothing to go in but if it's not there you go and hard to hack an html page certainly of course you can do like some javascript xxs stuff of course you can yeah there are some ways to go about it but there's just a lot less and it's difficult exactly so if you then talk about like things like scalability and flexibility of course all of the things we just discussed you can do with the monolith it's just more effort like and what i really enjoy about jam stack the scalability thing off it is just there are static files right there on a cdn edge you just put them in more places on that edge closer to people and scalability has been solved right you don't need to do like multiple content delivery servers like all of those complicated tools that you put in front of it to say okay this user goes to that server this user goes to that server and then hope the session is sticky like all that stuff gone traffic no more issues traffic management all of it oh my god yeah yeah so like we don't need a firewall now to your content management server anymore for example none of that is complex and so by flexibility i guess you know everything can be flexible but i'm also talking about you know developer experience flexibility wise if you're in a gemstack world you can kind of choose your tool set easily and you will see later on in the deck when i explain um you know our more inspirational architecture that's from 2018 and actually it's so flexible that if i wanted to modernize it to 2021 it was actually going to be really really easy but let's go there later all right so we actually did this monolith thing for so long and kind of when you explain this monolith versus jam stack to a client in a pitch like you kind of feel like this it's like all these drawbacks that i just explained why did we put those on the client they were paying us right yeah it's kind of ridiculous almost so before we jump into jam stack stuff tony do you have something there yeah i just want to say like even though we spent so much the previous slide even though we spent so much time in those monolith systems yeah they taught us a lot of things of how not to build websites so yeah and there's amp we have a lot of experience yeah and the thing is not how to not do it because there's a lot of successful sites with them and for me what those systems taught me is to build a website from a to c right all the parts are in it it's not just a front-end framework there's also back-end there's seo there's you know scaling there's cloud stuff so it it did teach me everything i know now and that makes it easier to go the gemstack route and actually do something right so we're not here to just say bad stuff about monoliths they're still there they're still a viable option right but let's just go into gemstack and just recite the basics just you know quick refresher okay so the j javascript any dynamic action in request response cycle are done with javascript everything is done on the client let's think on that that's kind of true right yeah either in build you do dynamic stuff or but if you then want to do any sort of request response cycle stuff ajax calls blah blah blah there are no servers right it's all javascript that talks to some api somewhere it's an endpoint yeah exactly yeah everything is a you have you still have server side rendering and you still have client-side and you have client-side rendering so server-side rendering happens at build time client-side rendering exactly you need some call to a weather api to get the weather for example yeah for example and the interesting thing about this is now like of course this is this um definition that i i actually took this from my previous deck from 2018 right nowadays i think there's a little bit more in between going on because what you could potentially do with let's say next and for cell is you can have a certain chunk to be dynamic render that with a lambda function automatically right because of for cell and then that would be then that output is cached on the cdn so nowadays it might be slightly more you know mixed up but in essence this is the point of the javascript in jam stack right it's all on the client yep and you're free you are flexible and free to do what if you want to do angular and react and jquery in one app go for it i don't suggest it but you know okay let's go apis all server-side processes or database actions are abstracted into reusable apis accessed only by javascript okay so apis kind of become microservices when you read it like this do you think that's true yeah i guess uh i guess this is like for example you have back-end developers and they're like okay what do i do now with all this jam stack i might not be interested not be interested to learn javascript and i want to continue writing my code and some back-end stuff because i don't believe javascript is secure some sort of stuff then they can take advantage of this area of jam stack and focus on building apis making them secure exposing them and allowing front-end developers or developers out there on the web to consume them so and this you make an interesting point because you're kind of defining back-end developers a little because what makes a back-end developer in a cms monolith monolithical driven world right it's a back-end developer to someone who grabs the data makes it available but also renders the mvc kind of thing into the template or should the front-end developer grab the data from the model and put it in the view because now that we have these javascript things that do like the the the view kind of thing did back-end developers get less work now in my opinion no because front-end developers in my opinion should grab the data from a model and render a template you know in the wordpress style or the sidecar style what do you think tony uh i i define it different i don't like to separate beckonsville from front of it to me developer is developer and agreed you and me we worked in consulting firms so yeah we were throwing on different projects and we had to either write code in javascript or net or java or node doesn't matter right so yeah if you want to pick up if you want to stay and continue building websites you pick up the modern stack if you want to continue doing your back-end stuff you focus on doing back-end stuff and make it available for exactly uh the jam stack sides for uh mac architectures to headless isn't it interesting to actually try to do something like a graphql endpoint if i were a back-end dev i would love to try that and make that scalable and see how that works right it's very interesting yeah i think the the issue as good we were talking about this that not the issue but jam stack is associated with just front-end developers html and css fast blogs but nobody thinks about the benefits that it can bring to enterprise and to these big projects that have had issues for years and exactly working with well i have been there but i've been privileged to work for bigger brands that just needed performance or specific things done and then gemstack was helping out a lot there so let's talk about markup here so markup is pre-built at deploy time this means we are building static html css and javascript websites i think this is probably still true unless you go to single page apps but is a single page app potentially also maybe in part at least jam stack i don't know it's a static front end right so you can so whenever you're building a single-page app uh you can have areas of the site with new modern tools you can have areas of the site that are static and some are dynamic but you can't you can't take that static site that's and then make a spot of it because it's all just html files in there just yeah but if you look at yeah but the thing is let's say i make an ajax call and i did get some data from a micro server somewhere that would become an sba and it's still jam stack because the client is making those ajax calls it might not be awesome for seo but that's a whole different jam stack friday's talk right yeah anyways let's go on so i think we have had a refresher now so let's talk about what a typical gem stack architecture actually looks like so what most people think it is or at least what they associate gemstock to be is probably something like this right so i just chose to put gatsby there even though i have a next hat on right we're everybody's happy we're all free we can choose what we want so generally it would be like a static site generator like gatsby getting data from somewhere maybe even just markdown files you commit to git and then get because there's an update your build system somewhere in the cloud either netlify for cell move web whatever they will notice that change do a build on their own cicd stack basically and then publishes that to the cdn edge and that's what the user gets to see i guess this is like the simplest it gets right elementary yeah how it starts and how everyone should just at least it's it's joy you once you do it once you're like oh my god this is so much fun yeah it brings back into web development totally because when i started to do this i was like okay this is like i came from that world where we had the wordpress like websites the sitecore like websites all good right that's where you come from so that's your paradigm and then this happened it was like hey why not do it that way but then what you can actually also do is the following right so you have the gatsby you have your git you have your built on net defy on the cdn whatever but there's also this microservices chunk as you can see there's like three cogs there basically signaling to the fact that there are multiple of those so you kind of have client and you have cdn edge and then you have services and you can expand that into anything you'd like right because you can see the arrows pointing from microservices to gatsby but the microservers also point to the build it also points to the cdn edge and it points to the client like there are limitless amounts of things you can do with these microservices as long as you can just orchestrate them together to do something on the client side correct yeah and we have a back-end developer who can find some stuff to do in this diagram and build my exactly and so i've worked with a bunch of people around like e-commerce stuff right where they are like commerce tools developers but i didn't understand comment search developers because commerce tools is just a thing with a rest api that's awesome but you know what they did they actually created lambda functions and services around commerce tools to enhance it and make better api endpoints for front-end developers for example and they had a full job full full-time job in projects doing just that like the devops aspect of this is great and so when i made this slide in like 2018 or 2019 maybe i don't know the gatsby thing is new but anyways i started to use this myself more and more right and then suddenly my whole um vision of how i saw the internet it kind of opened up the cloud changed stuff right and i kind of had this like i the internet was really fine for me i don't think i ever seen this show what is this from a show or something this is this is like the most uk comedy style show and so you're forgiven for not knowing this because it's a little obscure but i i love this so it's called the i.t crowd so i'm sure some of the people in the audience will have seen this um in the meantime my cat is trying to climb on my lap but he's failing so please give me a second anyways um so in this graph okay wait my cat is just this is not good give me a second this is the internet everything is live everything is live we're not gonna edit any of this okay so my cat is now released from my lag back in business so this tv show is um about the i.t department of a big company in london and so the dude that you see is clearly a nerd he's an i.t guy and then the lady is their new manager and they're always making fun of her and in this case he's showing her that this little box here is the internet and she actually believes him so she takes the box to a board meeting and says guys i have the internet and then for some reason she drops it and then the whole building collapses it's just it's super strange but that's like uk humor right it's just it's kind of it's crazy and super fun but like for me this just signifies like let's reinvent how the internet works in my mind here and so it's just this jam stack opened my career basically and completely changed how i work and so yeah there you go that's this tv show okay um let's talk a bit about you know another architecture that you can also use that still qualifies as gems that can hopefully inspire you in the comments or you as a viewer to also do something like this and if you see this and you think hey that's cool or hey that's not jam stack please let us know we love interaction oh meat fatty yeah i remember this project i did this a while back so this is 2019 as you can see on the slide here so i built this app because i was gaining a bunch of weight and the way i know how to lose weight is this there's an external kind of how do you call this like if people keep me accountable to me that helps i'm just a weak person like that i need accountability from the outside i need a bit of peer pressure so i thought why not take it to the next level and actually build an application to publicly show my weight loss progress and i did this because i wanted to speak at or i was speaking at the front and love conference in beginning of 2020 and i started this weight loss journey probably 25th of october 2019 and by the time the conference was there i wanted to have lost a certain amount of weight and every time i would step on the scale my app would update and a tweet would go out so people that knew i was going to speak knew about this thing so it was kind of a marketing thing for me but i was also showing people was losing weight or not and this is completely jam stacked with a whole bunch of fun stuff in it so tony would you ever expose yourself like that with accountability or am i just a little crazy no no this is good actually when i saw this i was thinking oh and i bought the the smart weight back then uh it was fitbit and i was like man oh yeah exactly i want to do something similar to this and uh but this is really i don't know if i would expose my stuff uh but hey i don't know what whatever we do for the twitters we do right and it's ways for me it kind of worked i i think i lost in the end six kilos or like 13 pounds or something like that it wasn't enough and people were like good job this is nice it helped me but also people were like talking to me like dude no you you gained weight this week what's happening right i had my friends tell me i had like dms they were watching you they were watching yes yes exactly so this website was built in fjs it was a pwa and it updates itself automatically by using web hooks right it's a really nice combination of how you can orchestrate stuff so it just few ds i used azure functions github netlify and it's a pwa it's a strange combination but back then it was quite okay i think so this is what it does in essence right i step on my within that will then update my pwa with my new weight so you see a new graph or a new date and then it would actually send a tweet with my progress and so people will always know where i was that day or that week and also if i didn't step on the scale because i thought i might have gained weight it would tweet that i didn't step on the scale oh that's very annoying so i could not trick it right i could not i could not game the system so let's just go over how i architected this and it likely won't work the same anymore nowadays but let's go over it so this whiffing skill what i thought it did initially is when i would step on it that it would always go to the withings back end and that that would update my phone because my phone would just read the database that was actually not true my the skill would directly connect to wi-fi and update my phone like in some sort of strange peer-to-peer system and then that would also then update the back-end database of withings which was i still don't really get how it works it's likely different now but anyways i was able to set up a web hook from withings api to something and so a web hook is basically if a machine to a machine fires a url and gives a bit of data right rather than me going and typing into a browser it's a machine that does that in this case it was the withings api and so we have that little chunk and i just make it small so there's a web hook to the next thing and so i had a serverless function or a lambda function if you will i don't think azure likes us to call it lambda functions but basically what this thing did is very simple it would receive the web hook with my new weight so the only thing that withings would send is like 100 kilos or 180 pounds or something like that right and then this function would grab that it would connect to github and then use the github api to do a commit into a json file with my new weight nice right makes sense it's strange but that's how that works because there are no databases here i don't want origins nothing right so it would actually do a commit for me with the github api right but because github had an update in a specific branch that would then actually trigger a netlify deploy because netlify was listening to a specific branch if that branch changes it would do a build and then of course when you do a build with netlify their cicd stack would rebuild my fatty application but that json file with all the dates and all my weights had been updated now so the fatty app would show a new weight and so it's totally static there's no database actions or ajax calls because the json file was local to the code base and then what i would also do is make an svg file that became like the same graph that you saw before but it would update every time the website was updated because in the build i created the svg and i used cloudanary to make that into a png file so i could use it as the share image and update that every time the website would be rebuilt okay i'm interested in that i want i want more can you expand on that a little more on the cloudiness part oh yeah sure and the funny thing is i only used cloudinary in this sense to not to create the whole svg i did that locally in in node.js but i used cloudinary because you cannot use a share image like an og tag image or a twitter card image as an svg those services just don't understand them and so what i did i would use the cloudinary fetch hook to actually create that image right so what it would do is it would no it's not creating what it did it was like it was like fatty.timbanex.comgraph.svg or something and then for my share image i would use timbanex.cloudenary.com fetch slash the url of my graph but in that same url i'd say file type png so what cloudenary would do is would it would fetch the original url on my origin on tembenex.com it would make it into a png and put that on their cdn and so that way i kind of decentralized rendering that image into a png on cloudenary and then my share image would be the whole url and then it would just grab it from the cloud in the area cdn for sharing if that makes any sense yeah it's just using the tools you have to your ex to your um ability right it's just just try connect as many things as you can and so we're not finished yet so we now have an updated app and we have a progress graph but netlify itself after the publication was done i set up a web hook from netlify to another lambda function because what i wanted to do is i wanted to tweet automatically what my new weight was and what the difference was with the last one and so this tweet progress function would actually use the github api again it would go to github and get that same json file that we used before and in there you have the start weight you have all the other weights and you have the dates because that's what i put into the json file with the publish wait function and so this tweet progress function actually had all the information needed to craft a fun tweet and publish that like tim lost one kilo or 2.2 pounds in four days that's not that much is it well actually it is much but and it would then also say things like hey tim gained like two pounds what happened fun stuff like that and so i did it this way because i didn't want any sort of database somewhere the database now was just github but it's just static it just sits somewhere and so this way there is no origin there are no surfers because those lambda functions would be used with an input and an output and just die off again i didn't pay for those and so yeah that was pretty intense and really simple once you grasp what it does and then this would be one of those uh tweets right and then when you click on the link you go to the application nice and so that's what i have for you today on this um crazy architecture and so tony what do you think is this actually jam stack yeah this is a this shows that with jam stack architecture you can go beyond just building a static block sure yeah or wherever you add in your weights you can uh utilize non-relational database for example and then the server function you can bring it now into netlify and have both of those functions there because it's so advanced i would likely have done quite differently now but but one thing also to say that whatever you built two years ago or three years ago yeah now you can easily improve without rebuilding everything because you were thinking with the right mindset with this yeah jam stack mac architecture everything decoupled so you're not yeah because now i wouldn't yeah exactly sorry to interrupt it i don't think i would use um azure functions now or if i did i would go to azure static websites or at this i would host it there right but now i would like if i didn't want to retouch any code i would just stick with netlify and use their lambda functions inside the same code base if i wanted to write a bit of code i would likely use maybe for cell and next and use the use of it so it's a little bit more integrated right but all in all it would be relatively simple to touch and change any of those because now with the the azure functions i had two separate functions that would do similar things without shared code i know in azure functions nowadays with version 3 you can have shared code but i guess if you had it all in the same code base like with netlify lambda functions or for cell api functions right you have it in the same code base so it's easier to share stuff but it still stands this thing and it's still pretty fun yeah no i like it i like a lot and this tells like if we have people on who are watching this and thinking uh how can they take advantage of this architecture and their thinking of implementation one of the main things to keep in mind is that as technology evolves new tools come out it's easier to swap and just keep improving stuff without rebuild yeah maybe exactly like a broken record but no but this is true you don't want to be re-platforming anymore it's just that's just from back in the day there's no longer any need oh that was a uniform plug nice anyways um we're pushing time a little bit this episode so um thank you for watching everyone if you feel like you have some sort of other architecture that you like please put it in the chat and we can maybe talk about that last time tony do you have some words to finish this thank you for sharing this project with us this is really great and see everybody soon yes cheers everyone bye
