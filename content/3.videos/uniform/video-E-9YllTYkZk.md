title: "Uniform CLI: how to manage your compositions"
description: "The Uniform CLI enables you to interact with Uniform from a command-line interface.\n\nIn this video, we go over how you can manage your component definitions and your compositions via the Uniform CLI. You can pull all data into a folder on your local machine to make some manual changes (or save all of it in git). \n\nYou can also push the data back to Uniform, making it easy to generate different environments for a project.\n\nThe documentation:\nhttps://docs.uniform.app/guides/tools/cli\nhttps://docs.uniform.app/reference/cli/canvas\n\nJoin our Discord server if you have questions:\nhttps://uniform.to/discord"
