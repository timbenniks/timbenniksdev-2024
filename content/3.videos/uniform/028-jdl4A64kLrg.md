title: "Agile Digital Delivery for startups - build a composable DXP for free in ten minutes!"
description: "Building a composable DXP doesn't have to be out of reach for companies just beginning their digital journey. Join Uniform's principal developer advocate Tim Benniks to see how you can start easily -- and at no cost -- by using free plans from major vendors. \n\nTim shows you how to use Uniform to turn Contentful, BigCommerce, NextJS and Vercel into a powerful, agile platform for digital delivery. And once you set it up, nontechnical users can use Uniform Canvas to create, launch and iterate digital experiences without coming back to the dev team."

transcript: "let's say you work at a startup and you're building a product but you need a marketing site that shows a bit of commerce and some personalization and some data from headless sources and you actually need a composable dxp and here at uniform we are able to give that to you it's going to be enterprise great and it's completely mac alliance focused and it's really simple to set up so in this video i want to show you how to do that by actually going through the system and setting it all up for you live so it's a one taker there's not going to be any edits and you can probably just follow along if you have the right prerequisites okay so let's starting by building our own dxp and so let's have a start because we need a couple of things right we need a cms and in this case we're going to go for contentful and for commerce i want to use big commerce and for a front-end framework we want next.js and a cdn delivery framework is going to be for cell and we will not be doing analytics for this demo and i also don't need a marketing cloud just now so i just created the stack that i like that uniform supports and let's actually launch our stack and get this demo on the road so signing me in let's see where we are so let's start a new product project because basically our personalization engine has realized the things that i just clicked it knows about me so when i now start my new project it will remember and it will select the right things for me and so what i want to do in this demo is grab a personalized gem stack website on for sale with commerce connected so we just why we selected bigcommerce right so let's rock um yes we're going for sell and you need a couple of prerequisites before you can do this smoothly so you need a github account so we can put the code repository for you on your account and we need a contentful account where you can add a new space you need a store owner login for bigcommerce so you're able to connect to that and we can query it and you need a for sale account of course to be able to deploy it to for sale all these things are actually free you can just go ahead and sign yourself up and then do this same flow and you're off to go all right so we're creating this new project now so we kind of have to figure out what to do with the content and it needs to log into contentful to be able to add the demo content there so i was already logged in so let me select the space i want to add my space to and let's call it dxp and create the space so this tool here is behind the scenes doing a lot of things with these headless systems and so we're actually adding some little applications from uniform into contentful and we're also adding our starter kit demo content into contentful for you so you have something to play with um here it goes it's processing the assets and it's publishing them and we should be ready to rock imminently there we go so um now we need to connect to big commerce and so let's see um i have been logged in already so let me just select my account and the store that i own there it is and now it's actually installed the big commerce app with uniform all ready so now comes the next thing what we need to do is behind the scenes lots of things have happened so we now need to connect everything up and put it on for cell and so to be able to do that it will create for us a github repository with the code inside and it will also deploy on for sale but for sell needs to know about a bunch of information about our uniform project id and the api keys and things like that and so let's click deploy to for cell and then copy paste all these items here and then once that is done it will redirect back to this page and we can have a look at the project we've created so we go so it opens in a new tab and so let's just make it a git repository it could also be bitbucket or something but we'll go for github and we call it dxp of course here we go let me just zoom you in a little there we go so we don't need a github team or this might be oh sorry this is a for cell team we don't need that and so what we need now is actually to copy paste those values that we just saw on the screen in here so for cell knows what to do to release our code base okay here we go so our contentful tokens copying everything by the way these tokens will be invalidated after this video so don't be clever and take my stuff you there won't be any need for that all right so i clicked on deploy and for sale is now going to do its business it has all the information it needs it grabbed the information from my github and now it should be able to build it and so this might take a little bit because it's the initial build it needs to get all the npm packages and things like that and so in the meantime let's have a look at my github account let's see what was added there oh that was almost good here we go so it just created this github repository for us and so everything is kind of nicely integrated like that and so you can see if you wanted to do this manually how everything works it's all here and so this is still building and so what i'll do is i'll wait for it to be done and i will just fast forward this so you can see we're doing everything live there's no edits here all right it actually worked and now we're being redirected back to our uniform page and so basically what you can do from now on everything works by the way but what you can do from now on is actually go to for sale and figure out what that website looks like which we'll do now and then afterwards we can explore some other things which we might not all do in this video i just wanted to show you the quick startup so let's go to our dashboard and have a look at our dxp and let's visit it and so here we go we just created a website with compass that is connected to contentful and it has products but as you can see these products are right now not really connected we still have to do that inside uniform so how about we do that so let's go back to our project and let's have a look at canvas so we have created a landing page that's this landing page here and inside you can see there's a header there's a hero and stuff and there's actually a product here and that product you see there's no bigcommerce product just selected yet so let's do that now and let's find something i'm not sure if we can find these no let's just do this lovely coffee brewer let's accept but there's actually more products here so also let's do another one where we do maybe some more kitchen related stuff yeah okay let's let's select this and let's actually save and publish so we haven't actually set up a web hook from uniform to for cell to be able to detect this change and then do an automated deploy i won't do that for this video if you set that up and you change anything here or you change anything in your cms it will actually update this file here and that's it for the video i wanted to keep it quick and as you can see there's um in a short time you can do a lot of things and feel free to visit our documentation or have a look at our other videos that we've done to look at our universe and all the things we're doing at uniform so thank you for watching and see you soon cheers"
