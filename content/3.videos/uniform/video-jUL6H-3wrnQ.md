title: "Uniform Platform for Developers"
description: "See more at: https://uniform.to/zzkFwx\n\nIn an ever expanding landscape of headless sources, developers are often the ones who have to connect them all. \n\nThe question of adding some products, content and personalization on one landing page always comes at a time developers are busy. The answer is generally “no” or a forced “yes, I’ll try to squeeze it in this week”.\n\nWouldn't it be cool if you only had to implement one SDK in your framework of choice and you never had to bother with this stuff again? This sounds too good to be true right? Let’s discuss what this SDK would look like.\n\nIt would allow content editors to drag and drop content from different headless sources to their heart’s content. They could add or remove integrations and even do an A/B test or add some personalization without having to wait for developers.\n\nIf the headless sources change, it would still work exactly the same way on the other end. Retrieve a page composition through an SDK function, map and enhance data to your liking and pass it as props to existing components. Regardless of tech stack, it would just work.\n\nI’m here to tell you we’ve actually built this. We proudly introduce Uniform, the world’s first truly composable DXP. The only DXP that gives developers the power of choice: from front-end framework to CDN to hosting as SSR, Jamstack, with Edge workers, partial SSG, anything goes.\n\nUniform offers a platform without opinion, without vendor lock-in and without a restricting roadmap. Not one integration is the center of the universe and nothing is tightly coupled.\nWant three different CMS systems and two commerce engines? Why not? Add an integration, query the data and map it to props for your components to use.\n\nNext to true composability regardless of tech stack, we’ve also introduced Uniform Canvas, a no-code composition builder that allows non-technical users to create experiences based on the components you define.\n\nUniform Canvas also provides a preview API with websockets, so end users can preview their composition live and in the actual codebase of the final product.\n\nUniform comes with an extremely flexible data enhancer API to help you map data from headless sources into your app. This API can run in your codebase or as an external service. We don’t care. Everything is built with flexibility in mind. You have the power of choice at your side.\n\nWe at Uniform know happy developers do better work. Good DX and great SDKs are just the beginning. With Uniform you can connect all the dots the way you like from a tech perspective. With a combination of out of the box tools for a fast time to market, and a set of APIs that allow extreme precision, we have created the world’s first truly composable DXP that will make both developers and content editors happy."
