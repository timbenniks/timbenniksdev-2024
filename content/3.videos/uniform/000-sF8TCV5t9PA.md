transcript: "this is Tim from uniform let's talk about headless 2.0 and uniforms dxcp [Applause] [Music] Atlas technology has gained popularity in web development offering benefits like high performance front-end Freedom better DX and management through apis however at scale complexities arise due to an endless need for glue code for connecting content sources and mapping data to fit existing components on top of that we get authoring issues caused by the disconnects between data entry and the front-end presentation content editors do not know what happens when they press publish in one of the connected systems to solve these problems currently this is what existing players in the market are doing one they make the CMS the center of the universe and connect external sources via Integrations on top of that they add data modeling capabilities for page layouts unrelated to core CMS functionalities and two they hard code all the connections in the front end forcing content editors to file it tickets to get any sort of update they might like in my experience Web projects succeed if there's a full team buy-in while headless promises freedom in an excellent developer experience it pushes the pain threshold of marketers and therefore it fills its skill we need to do two things to fix these issues one create simple easy to maintain front-end code bases that contain minimal glue code and Technical debt and two eliminate the need for Content editors to understand the abstractness of composable architectures in other words content editors need a visual workspace that connects to external sources and that allows them to select which exact content from these sources they need all they need to do is fill in the component Fields with that content without the need to know the origin of the data the result is a curated page specific Json output that can be consumed by the front end which now doesn't need to know how to connect to external data sources and map their data to fit existing components this is uniform dxep a transparent and simple platform on which to compose Pages based on design components which props point to a field in an external API endpoint uniform dxcp is not acms or a data Federation tool it's a visual workspace that knows which component points to which data source for a specific page composition the only data uniform stores are one of content strings like latest blog posts or the fact that a particular component variant for example image on the left or image on the right is shown in a specific context now that we know all this let's recap why Atlas 2.0 with uniform is the way to go connecting everything code first at scale is painful for both developers and content editors the former having to maintain connections and data mappings and the latter getting lost in an abstract rule of forms with no clue what happens when they click publish imposable architecture with headless sources must be a team buy not just a developer's dream combination we need a visual workspace that's one friendly to content editors but compromise free for developers and two agnostic and not a one-size-fits-all offering from a single CMS vendor in other words we need a modern composable form of old-school dxbs I think uniforms digital experience composition platform is that solution"
