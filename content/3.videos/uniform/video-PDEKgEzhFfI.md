title: "Why is Jamstack so important for the future of DXP"
description: "See more here: https://uniform.dev\n\nIn this video we will discuss why #Jamstack is so important for the future of DXPs.\n\nNowadays the general consensus is that Jamstack is the way to go. The modern web is origin-less and Jamstack allows us to make that happen.\n\nStatic sites allow for easy scaling. They also score high core web vitals due to extremely fast TTFB and the use of modern web frameworks such as Next and Nuxt. API calls and data mapping happen at build time so at runtime nothing time consuming has to happen.\n\nStill need dynamic stuff for personalization, A/B testing, product catalogs or user logins? Use CDN edge workers or #serverless functions that run on the same CDN instance as the site so they are blazing fast and close to the end user.\n\nFor the business users among you: Highly performant web pages lead to higher conversion rates and better SEO. They also scale without issue during the black Friday peak.\n\nFor the developers among you: Jamstack sites allow developers to choose their stack freely as the end result is a static site. Jamstack sites do not have an opinion of how they are build and where they run. They offer the #powerofchoice for developers."
