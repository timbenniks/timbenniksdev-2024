How to deal with composability as a developer, or as a leader. \n\nNatalia worked in the roles of frontend and full-stack developer, technical lead and software architect leading enterprise implementations and as a solutions architect advising on data intensive implementations. Now she leads the end-to-end DX for JavaScript devs on Azure. \nhttps://twitter.com/AnfibiaCreativa\n\nBack in the days when Natalia started working as a developer, the frontend was nothing but a couple of CSS and JavaScript files or lines injected to the HTML.
