As a speaker at conferences, I strive to deliver engaging and entertaining presentations that captivate my audience. I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and creativity to the stage, often incorporating live music performances and interactive elements. My talks, such as "A Vue into Rock & Roll," seamlessly combine web development concepts with my passion for music, allowing attendees to experience an innovative approach to learning.

One of my strengths lies in my ability to deliver high-production value, pre-recorded talks tailored for virtual events. This has made me a sought-after speaker in the developer community, as I can provide a polished and visually stunning experience even in an online setting.

However, my presentations are not just about imparting knowledge; they are also about creating a memorable and enjoyable experience for the audience. I aim to leave a lasting impression by infusing my talks with energy, humor, and a touch of showmanship. Whether it's through live coding demonstrations, interactive quizzes, or unexpected musical interludes, I strive to keep my audience engaged and entertained throughout the entire presentation.

Ultimately, my goal as a speaker is to inspire and educate while also providing an unforgettable experience that leaves attendees feeling motivated and excited about the topics I cover.

  Masters of ceremonies, commonly called emcees, offer a profound value at conferences. As a seasoned emcee, I usually start with an anecdote as introduction, followed by an in-depth Q\&A session that truly features the speakers and their content. Over the past few years, my emcee gigs have been largely virtual. Starting 2022, however, I've also acted as emcee at in-person conferences, such as Vuejs Amsterdam.
