  #body
  Masters of ceremonies, commonly called emcees, offer a profound value at conferences. As a seasoned emcee, I usually start with an anecdote as introduction, followed by an in-depth Q&A session that truly features the speakers and their content. Over the past few years, my emcee gigs have been largely virtual. Starting 2022, however, I've also acted as emcee at in-person conferences, such as Vuejs Amsterdam.
