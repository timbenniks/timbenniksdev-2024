Nowadays, you’re hard pressed to find an application with all the functionalities you need for delivering personalized digital experiences. Even though with headless solutions, you can select the best options for your goals, you can, through composability, easily connect the applications that drive personalized experiences. Still, simply adopting headless technologies isn’t enough; you also need a [composable architecture](https://uniform.dev/blogs/composable-architecture/composable-platforms-what-why-how) that fosters innovation and a seamless authoring experience for business users. 

The answer is Uniform [Digital Experience Composition Platform (DXCP)](https://uniform.dev/what-is-digital-experience-composition), whose vendor-agnostic capabilities scale to your needs, enabling you to assemble, change, and reassemble your tools as requirements evolve. But what is Uniform DXCP and why does it exist? Read on.

##What is Uniform DXCP?

Uniform DXCP is a new, unique product category with which you can effortlessly integrate legacy and composable services with your design system and front end of choice. In particular, you can switch to and maintain composable systems without having to build and support the connections among those systems. In a composable architecture, that means adding and removing the tools without breaking your personalized, omnichannel digital experience. 

##Why is now the time to move beyond the modern tech stack?

Similar to a composer who arranges the notes of a musical score, you’re the composer of your project’s tech stack. Say, your stack comprises various tools—a [headless content management system (CMS)](https://uniform.dev/blogs/headless-cms/uniform-for-headless-cms), a [commerce platform](https://uniform.dev/blogs/composable-architecture/uniform-for-headless-commerce), a digital asset management (DAM) system, and so on—from different vendors. By combining those technologies and hosting them on a [content delivery network (CDN)](https://uniform.dev/blogs/sitecore/deliver-better-digital-experiences-with-a-cdn), you render a webpage. 

Nonetheless, connecting headless tools with APIs doesn’t necessarily produce a high-quality or [composable experience](https://uniform.dev/blogs/composable-architecture/headless-versus-composable-everything-you-need-to-know). As your enterprise scales up, your business must grow as well, meaning that you must incorporate more and more applications into your tech stack, all of which are hard coded into one another through their app stores or your front-end technology. 

What you end up with is a messy, unwieldy, and inflexible tech stack—a maintenance headache  for your developers. Not to mention that [replatforming](https://uniform.dev/blogs/composable-architecture/switching-vendors-for-digital-architectures-without-replatforming) or rebuilding your project from scratch can be nightmarish and expensive. 

How do you transform your tech stack from a cacophony of integrations connected by endless [glue code](https://uniform.dev/blogs/glue-code) into a composable architecture that bridges your tools into a harmonious experience? You do it with digital experience composition.  

##How do you transition from chaos to composable with DXCP

With Uniform DXCP, you need not create and maintain the custom code that connects your APIs and front-end layers. Instead, you can compose and organize headless solutions in your tech stack without the exorbitant costs, laborious upgrades, and complexities. 

Here are the major benefits of moving to composable with Uniform DXCP: 

*   Remember the messy tech stack we cited earlier? [Monolithic architectures](https://uniform.dev/blogs/composable-architecture/the-mach-monolith) require development of new features or investment in complicated integrations. Not so with Uniform DXCP, whose API-orchestration layer handles the connections among your digital experiences and the applications that power them.
    
*   No more “publish and pray” moments. Uniform DXCP’s no-code orchestration layer accords business users an editor with which to drag and drop components wherever they want and preview the resultant display.
    
*   In DXCP, your front end is unaware of your connections so no proprietary limitations exist, and you can select any front-end technology you desire. Whether you choose Java or PHP, your digital experience remains consistent and seamless.
    
*   DXCP offers a new paradigm for page creation around where data lives and how you manage that data. No more worries about product information being displayed outside the context of its intended design and user experience. With Uniform sitting on the end of your design data and keeping domain data intact, you’re free to deliver digital experiences through multiple services at scale. 
    
##How do you fuel your stack with digital experience composition?

After you’ve built a composable architecture in DXCP:

*   Your developers can easily add features and swap out tools from the stack individually.
    
*   Your stack stays organized with no need for those time-consuming, costly integrations that impede your speed to market.
    
*   Your marketers can drag and drop the components they need to create personalized omnichannel experiences without developer assistance. 
    

The result is less code, greater agility and flexibility, and a more smooth approach for handling orchestration and integrating new tools into your tech stack.
