faqs:
  - question: "How do Composable DXP and universal CMS relate?"
    answer: "With composable DXP, brands can create digital experiences by integrating best-of-breed services, offering flexibility and customization. Universal CMS reinvents this idea by combining composable DXP strengths with traditional CMS ease of use, aiming to provide a more adaptable and user-friendly platform for diverse user needs."

  - question: "What are the key differences between headless CMS and traditional CMS?"
    answer: "Headless CMS separates content management from content delivery, leading to greater flexibility in presenting content across different platforms. Traditional CMS, on the other hand, tightly integrates content management with the presentation layer, making it easier for nontechnical users to manage content but less flexible for multichannel delivery."

  - question: "How does universal CMS address the limitations of purely headless systems?"
    answer: "Universal CMS aims to offer a comprehensive toolset for both developers and content creators. It integrates visual-editing tools into headless systems, restoring editorial control for marketers while maintaining the flexibility and technological openness that developers require."

  - question: "What role does API play in modern CMS architectures"
    answer: "APIs are crucial in modern CMS architectures, especially in headless and universal CMS systems. By enabling content delivery to front-end platforms and devices, APIs deliver greater flexibility in how and where content is presented."

Currently, the CMS industry is toughing through a significant shift in focus that has left many brands grappling with inadequate content-management tools. That shift, which some call a [midlife crisis](https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/content-managements-midlife-crisis/), prioritizes internal operations over the delivery of customer-centric content because vendors assume that content management is an issue of the past.

Central to that crisis is the fact that outdated systems and evolving user requirements have rendered content-management processes less effective. Furthermore, expectations for content creators are historically low, compromising the quality within CMS platforms. A significant transformation in the CMS landscape is in the offing, however, because, to meet their marketing needs, brands are clamoring for effective tools for content coordination, agility, and governance to be available by 2025\.

A potential solution is universal CMS, a balanced and efficient ecosystem that bridges the gap between technical and nontechnical users. That system springs from the industry's "race to the middle”—a convergence of the headless CMS, loved by developers for its flexibility; and the traditional CMS, favored by marketers and content creators for its visual-editing prowess.

To me, however, we're reinventing the wheel called composable DXP, which I've worked on for years, first at [Uniform](https://uniform.dev/) and now at [Contentstack](https://contentstack.com/).

**The race to the middle**

The convergence of headless and traditional CMS platforms, aka “the race to the middle,” is reshaping content management. Here’s a brief recap of the two platforms:

* **Headless CMS**: A developer favorite, the headless CMS offers a flexible, API-first approach, separating content management from the presentation layer and enabling developers to use any front-end technology.  
* **Traditional CMS**: A marketer and content-creator choice, the traditional CMS enables visual editing, simplifying content creation and management without requiring deep technical knowledge.

In essence, the race to the middle is about creating a unified platform that can cater to both technical and nontechnical users, ensuring that content management systems remain relevant and effective in an increasingly complex digital landscape. Through this race, headless CMS providers are adding visual-editing features to make their platforms more accessible to content creators. Simultaneously, traditional CMS vendors are enhancing their developer and API capabilities to appeal more to technical users.

## **The era of the content editor**

The industry saw all that coming and was waiting for a term to be coined. As a result of the race to the middle, the universal CMS offers a comprehensive solution with the key characteristics, also available through composable DXP, for developers, content creators, and other stakeholders alike, as follows:

* **Visual editing**, which ensures consistency and ease of use of content editing across presentation layers and technologies.  
* **Tech-agnostic development**, which, by supporting all frameworks and technology stacks, enables developers to use their preferred tools.  
* **Omnichannel capabilities**, which deliver content across channels and platforms through a seamless user experience.  
* **Stack-agnostic deployment**, which offers numerous infrastructure and deployment options, including on-premise and cloud-based solutions.

The increasing focus on collaboration has prompted the entire CMS industry to develop tools that better facilitate teamwork and that offer a more integrated CMS approach for developers, marketers, and content creators. As it gains traction, that industry-wide movement pushes for innovation and a more holistic approach to content management so vendors now sell to the full team instead of to developers or content editors only.

## **⁠The return of composable DXP**

While the universal CMS concept is intriguing, it closely mirrors what the industry calls composable DXP. Composable DXPs not only meet diverse user needs but also come with out-of-the-box tools for visual building, personalization, analytics, and automation. The minimal effort required to switch from a universal CMS to a composable DXP further underscores their similarity.

Initially, composable DXPs did not incorporate a CMS and merely offered a platform to connect best-of-breed tools for a digital experience platform. They patched the hole headless architectures left in the market, but content editors were still at a disadvantage. Nowadays, composable DXPs like [Contentstack](https://contentstack.com) offer all the tooling you need for a DXP, but everything is interchangeable with best-of-breed tools, i.e., composable to the max, replete with an opinion that focuses on the full team, offering a full experience on purchase.

Since it takes only minimal effort to switch from universal CMS to composable DXP, more and more vendors will return to DXP.

## **The position of the MACH Alliance**

The concept of the "race to the middle" raises questions about where the MACH Alliance stands in our space. Recently, a flexible developer-centric product that offers both self-hosted and cloud options was denied entry into the MACH Alliance, sparking a debate about the value of flexibility. In an era where data sovereignty and hybrid setups are becoming standard, restricting options seems out of step with modern needs.

Since future-proof solutions hinge on adaptability, not limitation, the focus should be on empowering users to make the best decisions for their unique circumstances. As more CMS platforms find a balance between headless and traditional, the MACH Alliance should consider what this change in the market means for users.

## **The ultimate result**

So, is universal CMS just composable DXP? Not exactly, but they share many core principles and goals, with composable DXP offering a slightly broader approach.

In essence, to ensure user-friendliness and flexibility, the CMS industry is adopting a new pattern that integrates visual editing, tech-agnostic development, and omnichannel delivery. That trend pushes the CMS industry closer to a holistic content-creation model that combines the best aspects of headless and traditional systems for a balanced platform for developers and content creators.

Whether we call it universal CMS or composable DXP, that evolution is a huge plus, for it's high time to make content management a "team buy” again. Not only are pain points dramatically reduced, but also stakeholders can focus on what truly matters—storytelling.

I couldn’t be happier to work at [Contentstack](https://contentstack.com), whose mantra is to empower the whole team on our platform.
