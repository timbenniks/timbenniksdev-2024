faqs:
  - question: What is a “Super-T” person?
    answer: A Super-T person extends the classic T-shaped model by adding an AI-powered connective layer that accelerates cross-domain work, automates translation between roles, and amplifies decision-making.
  - question: How can I become a Super-T product person?
    answer: Deepen your core skill, broaden your fluency across adjacent disciplines, and use AI tools to orchestrate workflows, prototype ideas, and iterate faster. Cultivate systems thinking and open collaboration.
  - question: Why does the Super-T model matter now?
    answer: Because AI makes cross-disciplinary work faster and cheaper, enabling individuals and teams to operate as adaptive systems rather than rigid pipelines.

That's a bold title, but it's time we admit it: the classic T-shaped model isn't enough anymore.

For years, we've celebrated people who have depth in one area and breadth across others. That's still valuable—but in today's AI-augmented world, the most effective product people are evolving into what I call **Super-T** individuals.

They don't just *know* across disciplines—they *connect, orchestrate, and iterate* them, often with the help of AI. Let's unpack what that means in practice.


### TL;DR

A Super-T is a modern evolution of the T-shaped person:

* Deep expertise in one field (the vertical).
* Broad fluency across related domains (the horizontal).
* And a third layer—a connective **AI-powered halo**—that speeds up learning, translation, and decision-making.

Super-T people operate as *systems thinkers* who use AI to bridge roles, iterate fast, and keep teams aligned.

### The why

Work has changed. AI has collapsed barriers that used to define job boundaries.

You don't need to be a designer to prototype. You don't need to be a developer to build a basic integration. You don't need a data team to analyze early feedback.
If you're curious and know how to guide AI, you can do enough of each to move ideas forward responsibly.

This isn't about replacing specialists. It's about amplifying what each person can do and how fast teams can learn together.

Super-T people are the connective tissue of modern teams—they make composable ways of working actually *work*.

### The how

Let's walk through the journey from T to Super-T. You don't get there overnight—it's a progression.

#### 1. Start with your deep core skill

This is your vertical bar. Be exceptional at one thing—product strategy, engineering, design, content, analytics, whatever.
You need to know what “good” looks like in your craft and be able to deliver it independently.

#### 2. Build horizontal fluency

Then widen your lens. Learn enough about adjacent roles to speak their language and anticipate their constraints.
If you're an engineer, understand UX trade-offs, copy tone, or go-to-market timing.
If you're a designer, understand business metrics and API limitations.

Breadth here isn't about mediocrity—it's about empathy and speed.

#### 3. Layer in AI as your connective halo

This is where the Super-T truly emerges.

AI tools—LLMs, design assistants, code scaffolds, analytics copilots—become your multiplier. You use them to *translate* ideas across domains: from research to spec, from sketch to prototype, from prototype to marketing narrative.

Over time, you develop intuition for *how* to work with AI:

* How to prompt and critique outputs
* When to trust versus override
* How to chain tools to automate context between disciplines

The goal isn't automation for its own sake—it's orchestration.

### A composable example

Let's ground this in a practical story.

Imagine you're building a composable web product—a small site where content, commerce, and analytics all plug together from different services.

* You start with your vertical skill: say, front-end architecture.
* You broaden into design and content modeling so you understand editor experience and SEO.
* You use AI to scaffold initial layouts, generate CMS schemas, and write early documentation.
* You use prototyping tools to validate flows and share them with your designer peers.
* You iterate on feedback, updating both code and copy directly.

In a few hours, you've covered what used to take multiple hand-offs. You still collaborate with specialists later—but now they enter with context, not confusion.

That's a Super-T workflow in action: composable, iterative, and AI-amplified.

### Challenges

Of course, it's not all sunshine and automation.

1. **AI veneer is real.** Just because you *can* generate designs, specs, or copy doesn't mean they're good. Depth still matters.
2. **Overconfidence kills collaboration.** A Super-T thrives in humility—knowing when to bring in experts.
3. **Tool fatigue is creeping in.** Every week brings new AI wrappers. Focus less on tools, more on *feedback loops*.
4. **Culture makes or breaks it.** Without trust, shared language, and documentation, your “Super-T” devolves into chaos.

Super-T thinking needs a culture of critique and openness, not heroics.

### Concluding

The Super-T is not a new job title—it's a mindset.

It's how composable teams actually become fast, aligned, and creative.
It's how product people evolve from builders of outputs to orchestrators of systems.

In my opinion, this is where the future of product work is heading:
less about individual expertise silos, more about *interconnected expertise*, powered by AI and grounded in trust.

*This is what it means to be a Super-T.*
