faqs:
  - question: What's the biggest mistake companies make with DevRel?
    answer: Treating it like marketing before fixing the developer experience. You can't amplify friction and expect trust.
  - question: How should DevRel teams measure success?
    answer: Focus on activation, retention, and satisfaction. Metrics tied to developer outcomes tell the real story.
  - question: What does empathy have to do with product strategy?
    answer: Empathy reveals friction points that shape product priorities. Done right, DevRel turns that feedback into design and growth decisions.

# DevRel Is Product Strategy Disguised as Empathy  
### A Field Guide to Building Trust, Teaching at Scale, and Measuring What Matters

That title sounds dramatic, and it should.  
After a long time in this space, I've realized that Developer Relations isn't about hype, funnels, or swag. It's **product strategy disguised as empathy**. DevRel sits between engineering truth and developer reality, translating friction into insight and insight into scalable understanding.

This playbook distills lessons from the field, shaped by my own work leading DevRel programs and the thinking of folks like **Marcos Placona** and **Lee Robinson**. Together, they form a practical blueprint for how to build trust, create clarity, and grow developer ecosystems that last.

---

## 1. Fix experience before awareness

No launch campaign can compensate for a confusing developer setup.  
If it takes ten minutes to get credentials or the sample app throws an error, you've already lost them.  

DevRel amplifies success, not friction. It's an echo chamber of your product's reality, make sure the echo is worth hearing.

---

## 2. Docs should mirror developer problems

Support tickets aren't noise; they're UX feedback.  
If the same questions keep coming, your docs are organized by *features*, not *problems*.  

Restructure content around the developer journey: problems, solutions, and examples.  
As Lee Robinson says, “Good documentation is your best salesperson.”

---

## 3. Teach, don't pitch

Developers don't wake up wondering about your product's feature set. They wake up trying to solve a problem.  

Effective DevRel content teaches a workflow, not a brand. When you educate, you earn trust. When you pitch, you lose it.  

Teaching *how to build great products* is the most persuasive marketing there is, especially when the example feels real, like improving site speed or integrating personalization.

---

## 4. Build less, explain more

Adding integrations for every framework won't help if your API or SDK isn't clear.  
Start with one rock-solid starter repo that works out of the box, complete, typed, and verified.  

One credible path to success beats a dozen partially-working abstractions. Clarity compounds faster than code volume.

---

## 5. Fix before you amplify

DevRel is only as good as the product it represents.  
If the developer experience is painful, advocacy just multiplies the pain.  

Fix it first, then amplify it. As Lee Robinson reminds us: “Developer marketing works only when you have something genuinely useful to show.”

---

## 6. Measure the funnel, not the noise

Most teams stop measuring at signups.  
The real metrics are activation, retention, and satisfaction.  

Track the path from signup → first success → production.  
Every leak you fix is worth more than every new lead you chase.

---

## 7. Retention compounds, acquisition decays

New developers are expensive; retained ones become advocates.  

Focus half your DevRel energy on retention: improved onboarding, faster support, better docs.  
Acquisition is short-term growth. Retention is a strategy.  

If you're always chasing new audiences, it means you're not keeping the ones you already earned.

---

## 8. Community size ≠ community health

That Slack workspace with 3,000 developers and five people talking? That's not a community, that's a helpdesk with a crowd.  

Healthy communities have pulse: people answer each other, share examples, and build together.  
Curate quality, reward engagement, and sunset quiet spaces when energy fades.

---

## 9. Turn support into a strategy engine

Every GitHub issue, forum post, or community message hides a data point.  
Cluster them and you'll find the same five root causes behind most friction.  

The questions developers ask most often are your next ten pieces of content.  
Your community is telling you what to build, if you're listening.

---

## 10. Invest in compounding assets

Conference booths and stickers fade.  
Code examples, API guides, and open demos keep earning trust long after you've gone home.  

Content optimized for search and problem discovery grows while you sleep.  
DevRel should build assets that keep working when you stop.

---

## 11. Speak in code, not slogans

Developers can detect marketing within seconds.  
The fastest way to build trust is to show, not tell.  

Use concise, runnable examples, not adjectives.  
As Lee Robinson notes, “The code should do the talking.”

---

## 12. Always show what happens next

Most onboarding flows end at “it runs!”, but don't explain what success looks like next.  
Show developers how to deploy, extend, and measure value in production.  

Momentum is a product feature. Nudge them toward mastery, not maintenance.

---

## 13. Create trust through transparency

Publish changelogs, share post-mortems, and show how you learn publicly.  
Open culture builds more goodwill than polished marketing ever could.  

Developers don't need perfect companies; they need honest ones.

---

## 14. Redefine success metrics

Impressions and followers are vanity metrics.  

True DevRel success looks like faster onboarding, fewer support tickets, and more developers reaching production.  
When metrics align with developer outcomes, everything else follows.

---

## 15. Prune and restart when needed

Sunset stale spaces, archive quiet channels, and spin up new ones with intent.  
Communities evolve, pruning keeps them alive.  

It's healthier to reboot with 50 engaged contributors than maintain the illusion of thousands of ghosts.

---

## 16. Open beats gated

Developers trust open content. Make everything searchable, public, and runnable.  
Gating docs might capture leads, but it destroys discoverability, and trust.

---

## 17. Design experiences, not just documentation

A successful DevRel program thinks like UX for engineers.  
It's not just about docs or samples, it's about emotional clarity.  

The moment a developer says “ah, that makes sense” is your real activation metric.

---

## 18. Focus breeds clarity

Trying to be everywhere just creates noise.  
Pick the platforms, languages, and frameworks that matter most to your audience and go deep.  

Precision beats presence.  
If you're active everywhere, you're probably resonating nowhere.

---

## 19. Empathy backed by evidence

Empathy in DevRel isn't about niceness; it's about data-driven understanding.  
Listen, analyze, and respond with proof, working code, examples, and fixes.  

That's how credibility compounds.

---

## 20. Build developer trust as your primary asset

Lee Robinson calls trust “the currency of developer marketing.” Once broken, it's nearly impossible to rebuild.  

Everything in DevRel, docs, content, APIs, communication, either adds to that trust bank or spends from it.  
Guard it like uptime.

---

## 21. Make content concise and precise

Developers value signal over storytelling.  
Keep posts tight, actionable, and code-forward.  

As Lee writes, “Cut fluff. Keep it practical. Make it clear how to get from A to B.”  
Less writing, more doing.

---

## 22. Community is shared ownership

Good DevRel turns users into co-builders.  
Encourage pull requests, spotlight community packages, and celebrate experiments.  

Shared ownership creates loyalty, people protect what they help build.

---

## 23. Marketing through teaching

The future of developer marketing is education.  

Every blog, video, or talk should make the reader better at their craft, regardless of whether they adopt your product.  
That generosity builds gravity. People come back because you help them grow.

---

### In summary

Modern DevRel lives where empathy meets execution, trust, clarity, and measurable outcomes.  
It's not promotion; it's infrastructure for understanding.  

Credit where it's due: thinkers like **Marcos Placona** and **Lee Robinson** helped shape this modern lens, one that treats DevRel not as marketing, but as **a living extension of product design**.  

At its best, DevRel makes technology feel human again.  
That's product strategy disguised as empathy.
