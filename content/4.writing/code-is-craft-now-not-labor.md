faqs:
  - question: Is programming really becoming obsolete?
    answer: No, and that's exactly the point. Programming as a discipline is more relevant than ever. What's changing is the manual act of writing every line by hand. The skills that make great programmers - systems thinking, architecture, debugging intuition, communication - remain essential. The keyboard part is becoming optional. That's a meaningful difference.
  - question: What does the knitting analogy actually mean for developers?
    answer: Knitting went from necessity to craft when industrial manufacturing took over textile production. Nobody needs to knit a scarf anymore - you can buy one for a few euros. But millions of people still knit because the process itself is rewarding. Programming is heading the same direction. You won't need to write code by hand to ship software, but many people will choose to because the act of coding is satisfying and creative in ways that directing an agent isn't.
  - question: Do you still need traditional coding skills if AI agents can write code?
    answer: Absolutely. AI agents amplify what you already know. You still need to architect systems, reason about trade-offs, understand performance implications, debug subtle failures, and communicate technical decisions to stakeholders. The difference is that instead of expressing all of that through manual keystrokes, you express it through precise intent and AI translates that into implementation. The thinking is the same. The interface is changing.
  - question: Should junior developers still learn to code from scratch?
    answer: Yes, emphatically. You can't direct what you don't understand. Learning to code builds the mental models, debugging intuition, and architectural taste that make you effective with AI tools. Skipping that foundation is like trying to direct a film without understanding cinematography. The craft informs the vision, even when you're not the one holding the camera.

You don't need to knit a scarf. You can buy one at H&M for twelve euros. It'll keep you warm. It'll look fine. Nobody will know the difference.

Millions of people knit anyway. They obsess over yarn weight, needle gauge, stitch patterns. They spend forty hours making something they could have bought in five minutes. Not because the output demands it, but because the process itself is the point.

I think programming is heading there. For some of us, it's already arrived.

## Coding is largely solved

Let me be specific.

If you have a clear product vision, understand the architecture you want, and can articulate the constraints precisely, AI agents can produce the code. Not a rough draft. Production-ready, tested, deployable code. I've built entire products where my contribution was the thinking, the directing, the taste - and the agent handled the implementation.

I wrote about this in my piece on [taste being everything when output is cheap](https://timbenniks.dev/writing/when-output-is-cheap-taste-is-everything). When producing something approaches zero cost, the bottleneck shifts to knowing what's worth producing. What I'm saying now is more specific: _the act of manually writing code, line by line, is becoming optional for getting software built._

That doesn't mean coding is dead. This distinction matters more than most people realize.

## Coding versus producing code

Coding and producing code are not the same thing. Producing code is about the output - functions, modules, shipped features. Coding is about the process - thinking in syntax, reasoning through logic, feeling a program take shape under your fingers.

When I say coding is becoming like knitting, I mean the _process_ is decoupling from the _output_. You will still need to produce code. But writing it by hand is no longer the only path - or even the most efficient path - to production software.

All the skills that make a great developer? Still essential. Systems thinking. Architectural judgment. Debugging things you've never seen before. As I argued in [my piece about AI making developers more valuable](https://timbenniks.dev/writing/ai-is-not-replacing-developers-it-is-exposing-everyone-else), these skills become _more_ important because the execution layer is handled.

_The thinking is the same. The interface is changing._

## The knitting parallel runs deeper than you'd expect

Before industrial textile manufacturing, knitting was labor. Families knitted because they needed clothes. When machines took over, knitting didn't disappear. It transformed from something you _had_ to do into something you _chose_ to do.

And the craft got _better_ once it became optional.

Remove the pressure of production and people start experimenting. They develop techniques that prioritize beauty over efficiency. They create patterns that would never make economic sense in a factory but are stunning as handmade pieces. Communities form around the craft itself - sharing techniques, celebrating skill, pushing boundaries.

Programming is following the same arc. Imagine people writing Rust for the pure satisfaction of fighting the borrow checker and winning. Someone spending a weekend implementing a ray tracer in a language they'll never use professionally. Handwritten code as genuine expression - intentional and personal in ways that AI-generated code never will be.

That community already exists. It's about to get a lot bigger.

## Where I am right now

I'm in the production phase. The productivity gains from AI tooling have been so dramatic that I'm shipping at a pace I've never experienced in twenty years. Real products, documentation, tools - all at a speed that would have required a small team two years ago.

Right now, I don't write much code by hand. I produce. I direct. I architect. It's exhilarating.

But I can already feel the pull. Once this pace settles, I know I'll come back to writing code for fun. Not because I need to. Because there's something about manually crafting a solution that no amount of AI prompting can replicate.

It's the difference between asking someone to cook you dinner and cooking it yourself. The meal might taste the same. But the experience of making it - the timing, the small adjustments, the satisfaction of a dish that came together because _you_ understood the ingredients - that's irreplaceable.

## It's not all sunshine and rainbows

Knitting survived as a craft because the barrier to entry stayed low. Yarn is cheap. Anyone can learn basic stitches in an afternoon.

Programming as a craft might not have that luxury. If writing code becomes disconnected from production value, the surrounding ecosystem could contract. Fewer tutorials aimed at manual coding. Fewer entry points for people who would have discovered the joy of programming through necessity.

There's also the question of whether craft coding becomes exclusive - a hobby for people who already have deep knowledge, while newcomers skip straight to AI-directed production. Some of the best developers I've known discovered their talent because they _had_ to write code. Losing that on-ramp would be a real loss.

_You can't knit for pleasure if nobody ever taught you to hold the needles._

## Concluding

Programming is not dying. It's graduating. Moving from labor to craft. The developers who recognize this early - who learn to direct AI for production while preserving their love of the craft itself - will have the best of both worlds.

Ship software at the speed of thought during the day. Write unnecessary, satisfying code on the weekend.

_The choice to code when you don't have to is what turns it from a job into an art._
