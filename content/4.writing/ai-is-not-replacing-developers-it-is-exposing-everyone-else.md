faqs:
  - question: Why do developers benefit more from AI than other roles?
    answer: Developers benefit because their work has tight feedback loops and measurable outputs. Code either ships or it doesn't. AI amplifies this without degrading quality when used well, allowing developers to remove drag like boilerplate, refactors, and documentation work.
  - question: Does this mean companies need fewer product managers and other roles?
    answer: Not necessarily fewer people, but fewer layers between problems and code. The shift means everyone else needs to re-anchor themselves to something real - a feature, a workflow, a shipped outcome - rather than staying abstract.
  - question: What does "execution density" mean in this context?
    answer: Execution density refers to how much actual value gets created per unit of work. AI rewards roles that turn intent into shipped artifacts (high execution density) rather than roles focused on coordination, signaling, or abstraction (lower execution density).

For the last year, the dominant narrative has been that AI will replace developers. That coding will be automated. That engineering teams will shrink while everyone else somehow adapts.

I think that narrative has it backwards. At least for now.

Here's what's actually happening inside companies: developers are the _only_ role that consistently benefits from AI-driven "5× productivity" mandates. Not because they're special, but because their output is real, measurable, and compounding.

**Code ships or it does not.**

AI fits perfectly into that loop.

## The developer advantage

A strong developer with AI doesn't suddenly work five times harder. They remove five categories of drag. Boilerplate disappears. Refactors accelerate. Migrations become tolerable. Tests get written. Docs get generated. The feedback loop tightens, not loosens. The result is velocity.

Now contrast that with most other roles.

A product manager isn't five times more effective by producing fifty PRDs instead of two. In fact, that's usually worse. The constraint in product work isn't document production - it's judgment, prioritization, decision-making, and alignment. AI can help clarify thinking, but it can't multiply accountability or taste.

_More artifacts do not equal more progress._

## The uncomfortable truth

This is what many organizations are avoiding: AI doesn't reward activity. It rewards _execution density_. Roles where value is created by turning intent into shipped artifacts scale dramatically. Roles where value is created through coordination, signaling, or abstraction? They don't scale linearly at all.

Companies think they're buying efficiency. What they're actually doing is selecting for roles closest to production.

Developers benefit because their work has tight feedback loops. You know quickly if something worked. You know when value was created. AI amplifies that without degrading quality (if used well).

Meanwhile, AI exposes how much organizational work existed to _compensate_ for slow shipping. Layers of planning, handoffs, decks, and rituals made sense when shipping was expensive. When shipping becomes cheap, those layers start to look like friction instead of leverage.

## The real shift

This is why the real shift isn't fewer developers. It's _fewer layers between a problem and code_.

AI doesn't replace developers. It raises the bar for everyone else to justify their seat next to someone who can now ship at absurd velocity.

The future organization isn't one where AI does everything. It's one where fewer people are allowed to stay abstract. Everyone else will need to re-anchor themselves to something real: a feature, a workflow, a shipped outcome.

That's not a threat. It's a correction. And developers, for once, are not on the wrong side of it.
