  I design developer platforms and build AI-augmented products that help teams move from shipping faster to shipping the right things.

  For most of my career, I’ve worked at the intersection of engineering, product, and developer experience. I’ve led platform initiatives, built extensibility ecosystems, and helped global teams adopt composable architectures that developers actually use.

  Today, my work focuses on how AI is reshaping software development, the growing overlap between engineers and product leaders, and why developer experience has become a strategic advantage rather than a support function.

  title: How I got here
  ---
  :::

  I didn’t set out to become a platform thinker. I started as an engineer who cared deeply about how things were built and how teams worked together.

  Agency life taught me scale. Working with global brands meant building systems that could survive real-world complexity, not just demos. Later, in the startup world, I focused on developer ecosystems, SDKs, and the surfaces that determine whether a platform is adopted or ignored.

  Along the way, I discovered something that shaped my career: the success of a platform has less to do with features and more to do with the experience of building on it.

  That insight pulled me toward developer experience, platform strategy, and eventually product ownership.

    My current work centers on three areas:

    **Developer platforms and extensibility**

    Designing marketplaces, SDK ecosystems, and platform surfaces that enable teams to build on top of products safely and at scale.

    **AI-augmented engineering**

    Exploring how AI accelerates execution while increasing the importance of architecture, constraints, and judgment.

    **The engineer–product convergence**

    Helping teams embrace a reality where engineers shape product direction because building is the fastest way to discover what works.

  title: What I believe
  ---
  :::

  :::content-richtext
  #body  
    speed is solved. direction is not.

    AI has dramatically reduced the cost of building. The hard part now is deciding what’s worth building.

    **Developer experience is product strategy**

    Platforms win when developers can extend them with confidence. DX is not documentation. It is the product surface.

    **Taste is a technical skill**

    Good engineers optimize for correctness. Great ones also optimize for coherence, usability, and long-term clarity.

    **Building is discovery**

    The fastest way to validate an idea is to prototype it. Specs should capture what we learn, not prevent us from learning.

---
:::

:::content-richtext
#body  
  I create talks, videos, and writing that explore the future of engineering, developer platforms, and AI-accelerated development. My goal is not to predict trends, but to make sense of the shifts we are already living through.

  I live in the French countryside, where the slower pace is a useful counterweight to an industry obsessed with speed. Some of my best ideas arrive away from the keyboard.
