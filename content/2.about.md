  My name is Tim Benniks. I'm a Dutchman living in France where I work remotely from a farm in the countryside. I'm the Developer Relations Lead for Outreach and Awareness at [Hygraph](https://hygraph.com "https://hygraph.com").
  
  Before I joined [Hygraph](https://hygraph.com "https://hygraph.com") I worked for [Uniform](https://uniform.dev "https://uniform.dev") as director of developer relations and I spend about 15 years at agencies building websites for huge brands. I was global front-end director at [Valtech](https://valtech.com "https://valtech.com") Principal front-end developer at [AKQA](https://akqa.com "https://akqa.com").
  
  In 2020 I forged a new career path for myself by re-exploring my creativity. I’ve been a lifelong musician and since we moved countries many years ago, I didn’t play much. The agency life was resting heavy on my shoulders and I missed sharing with my community and being creative.
  
  I jumped right in and decided to make a new YouTube video each week and to start speaking at conferences once a month. This creative path changed my life. I learnt a lot from the developer community and I started to make a name for myself.
  
  The outcome of a year if creative work was a job at a start up where I led developer relations. Fast forward a few years and I'm now on solid ground in the start up world continuing with roles in developer relations like the one I landed at Hygraph in 2023.

  I love to explore my creativity by making videos, live streams and speaking. Now that virtual conferences are a thing I have specialised in making entertaining, high production value talks that I pre-record.
  
  On my [YouTube](https://youtube.com/timbenniks "https://youtube.com/timbenniks") channel I explore web development related topics but I also conduct interviews and I try out services with live commentary.
  
  Making all these videos is lot's of work. If you like what you see, feel free to subscribe or even [sponsor](https://buymeacoff.ee/timbenniks "https://buymeacoff.ee/timbenniks") me.
